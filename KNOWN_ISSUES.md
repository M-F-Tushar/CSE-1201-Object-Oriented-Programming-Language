## 📝 Naming Inconsistencies

### ✅ FIXED: Folder Name Typo: "Leacture" vs "Lecture"

**Status:** Fixed (November 2024)

**Issue:** Some C++ lecture folders used "Leacture" instead of "Lecture"

**Resolution:** All affected folders have been renamed to use correct spelling "Lecture":
- ✅ `OOP in C++/Lecture_01: An Overview of C++/`
- ✅ `OOP in C++/Lecture_02: Introducing Classes/`
- ✅ `OOP in C++/Lecture_03: A Closer Look at Classes/`
- ✅ `OOP in C++/Lecture_04: Arrays, Pointers, and References/`
- ✅ `OOP in C++/Lecture_05: Function Overloading/`
- ✅ `OOP in C++/Lecture_06: Introducing Operator Overloading/`
- ✅ `OOP in C++/Lecture_07: Inheritance/`
- ✅ `OOP in C++/Lecture_08: Introducing the C++ IO System/` (also fixed spacing)
- ✅ `OOP in C++/Lecture_09: Advanced C++ IO/`
- ✅ `OOP in C++/Lecture_10: Virtual Functions/`
- ✅ `OOP in C++/Lecture_11: Generic Functions/`
- ✅ `OOP in C++/Lecture_12: Run-Time Type Identification and the Casting Operators/`
- ✅ `OOP in C++/Lecture_13: Namespaces, Conversion Functions, and Miscellaneous Topics/`
- ✅ `OOP in C++/Lecture_14: Introducing the Standard Template Library/`

All folder names now consistently use "Lecture" with proper spacing throughout the repository.
