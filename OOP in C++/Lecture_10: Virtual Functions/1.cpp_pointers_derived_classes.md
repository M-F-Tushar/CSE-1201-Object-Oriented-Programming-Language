# 10.1 POINTERS TO DERIVED CLASSES

## Overview

This chapter introduces a crucial concept in C++ object-oriented programming: **base class pointers can point to derived class objects**. This feature is fundamental to implementing polymorphism and virtual functions, representing one of the most powerful aspects of C++ inheritance.

---

## Core Concept

### Base Pointer to Derived Object
A pointer declared as pointing to a base class can also point to any object of a class derived from that base class without generating type errors.

### Basic Syntax
```cpp
base *p;              // base class pointer
base base_ob;         // object of type base
derived derived_ob;   // object of type derived

// Valid operations
p = &base_ob;         // p points to base object
p = &derived_ob;      // p points to derived object (LEGAL!)
```

---

## Key Rules and Restrictions

### ✅ What IS Allowed

1. **Base pointer → Derived object**: Always permitted
   ```cpp
   base *ptr = &derived_object;  // Legal
   ```

2. **Access inherited members**: Base pointer can access base class members
   ```cpp
   ptr->base_function();  // Works - inherited member
   ```

### ❌ What is NOT Allowed

1. **Access derived-only members**: Base pointer cannot access derived-specific members
   ```cpp
   ptr->derived_only_function();  // ERROR - not accessible
   ```

2. **Derived pointer → Base object**: Not permitted without casting
   ```cpp
   derived *ptr = &base_object;  // ERROR - type mismatch
   ```

### ⚠️ Important Warnings

1. **Pointer Arithmetic**: Operates based on declared type, not actual object type
   ```cpp
   base *ptr = &derived_array[0];
   ptr++;  // Moves by sizeof(base), not sizeof(derived)!
   ```

2. **Type Casting**: While possible, not recommended
   ```cpp
   derived *ptr = (derived*)&base_object;  // Dangerous!
   ```

## Detailed Example Analysis

### Complete Program Breakdown

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base {
    int x;
public:
    void setx(int i) { x = i; }
    int getx() { return x; }
};

class derived : public base {
    int y;
public:
    void sety(int i) { y = i; }
    int gety() { return y; }
};

int main() {
    base *p;        // pointer to base type
    base b_ob;      // object of base
    derived d_ob;   // object of derived
    
    // use p to access base object
    p = &b_ob;
    p->setx(10);    // access base object
    cout << "Base object x: " << p->getx() << '\n';
    
    // use p to access derived object
    p = &d_ob;      // point to derived object
    p->setx(99);    // access derived object
    
    // can't use p to set y, so do it directly
    d_ob.sety(88);
    
    cout << "Derived object x: " << p->getx() << '\n';
    cout << "Derived object y: " << d_ob.gety() << '\n';
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation

#### Class Definitions
```cpp
class base {
    int x;                    // Private data member
public:
    void setx(int i) { x = i; }  // Setter for x
    int getx() { return x; }     // Getter for x
};
```
**Base Class Features:**
- Single private data member `x`
- Public interface for accessing `x`
- Will be inherited by derived class

```cpp
class derived : public base {
    int y;                    // Additional private member
public:
    void sety(int i) { y = i; }  // Setter for y
    int gety() { return y; }     // Getter for y
};
```
**Derived Class Features:**
- Inherits all public members from `base`
- Adds additional member `y`
- Has access to both `x` (inherited) and `y` (own)

#### Variable Declarations
```cpp
base *p;        // Pointer that can point to base or derived objects
base b_ob;      // Concrete base class object
derived d_ob;   // Concrete derived class object
```

#### Memory Layout Visualization
```
b_ob (base object):
[x]

d_ob (derived object):
[x][y]  // x inherited from base, y added by derived
```

#### Operation 1: Base Pointer to Base Object
```cpp
p = &b_ob;      // Point to base object
p->setx(10);    // Call inherited function
cout << "Base object x: " << p->getx() << '\n';
```
**What Happens:**
- `p` points to `b_ob`
- `p->setx(10)` sets `b_ob.x = 10`
- `p->getx()` returns `10`
- **Output**: `Base object x: 10`

#### Operation 2: Base Pointer to Derived Object
```cpp
p = &d_ob;      // Point to derived object (LEGAL!)
p->setx(99);    // Access inherited member
```
**What Happens:**
- `p` now points to `d_ob` (a derived object)
- `p->setx(99)` sets `d_ob.x = 99` (inherited member)
- Base pointer can access inherited members

#### Operation 3: Accessing Derived-Only Members
```cpp
// p->sety(88);     // ERROR! Base pointer doesn't know about sety()
d_ob.sety(88);      // Must access directly
```
**Why Direct Access is Needed:**
- Base pointer `p` has no knowledge of `sety()` function
- Must use the actual object `d_ob` to access derived-specific members

#### Final Output
```cpp
cout << "Derived object x: " << p->getx() << '\n';  // Output: 99
cout << "Derived object y: " << d_ob.gety() << '\n'; // Output: 88
```

### Complete Program Output
```
Base object x: 10
Derived object x: 99
Derived object y: 88
```

## Practical Applications

### Why Use Base Pointers to Derived Objects?

1. **Polymorphism Foundation**: Essential for virtual function implementation
2. **Container Uniformity**: Store different derived types in same container
3. **Interface Consistency**: Work with objects through common base interface
4. **Runtime Flexibility**: Decide object behavior at runtime

### Real-World Example
```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() = 0;  // Pure virtual function
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override { cout << "Drawing circle\n"; }
};

class Rectangle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override { cout << "Drawing rectangle\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Shape* shapes[] = {new Circle(), new Rectangle()};
    
    for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        shapes[i]->draw();  // Polymorphic behavior!
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Attempting to Access Derived Members
```cpp
// WRONG
base* p = &derived_obj;
p->derived_function();  // ERROR!

// CORRECT
derived_obj.derived_function();  // Direct access
```

### Pitfall 2: Pointer Arithmetic Issues
```cpp
// DANGEROUS
derived array[5];
base* p = &array[0];
p++;  // Points to wrong location!

// SAFE
derived* p = &array[0];
p++;  // Correctly points to next derived object
```

### Pitfall 3: Improper Casting
```cpp
// DANGEROUS
base obj;
derived* p = (derived*)&obj;  // obj doesn't have derived members!
p->derived_function();        // Undefined behavior!
```

## Exercise Section

### Exercise 1: Experiment with the Example

**Original Instruction**: "On your own, try the preceding example and experiment with it. For example, try declaring a derived pointer and having it access an object of the base class."

#### Extended Exercise Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base {
    int x;
public:
    void setx(int i) { x = i; }
    int getx() { return x; }
    void show_base() { cout << "Base class method called\n"; }
};

class derived : public base {
    int y;
public:
    void sety(int i) { y = i; }
    int gety() { return y; }
    void show_derived() { cout << "Derived class method called\n"; }
};

int main() {
    cout << "=== VALID OPERATIONS ===\n";
    
    // 1. Base pointer to base object
    base* bp;
    base b_obj;
    bp = &b_obj;
    bp->setx(100);
    cout << "Base ptr->Base obj: x = " << bp->getx() << "\n";
    
    // 2. Base pointer to derived object  
    derived d_obj;
    bp = &d_obj;
    bp->setx(200);
    d_obj.sety(300);  // Must access derived members directly
    cout << "Base ptr->Derived obj: x = " << bp->getx() << "\n";
    cout << "Direct access to y = " << d_obj.gety() << "\n";
    
    // 3. Derived pointer to derived object
    derived* dp;
    dp = &d_obj;
    dp->setx(400);
    dp->sety(500);
    cout << "Derived ptr->Derived obj: x = " << dp->getx() 
         << ", y = " << dp->gety() << "\n";
    
    cout << "\n=== INVALID OPERATIONS (COMMENTED) ===\n";
    
    // 4. Derived pointer to base object - NOT ALLOWED
    // derived* dp2 = &b_obj;  // ERROR: cannot convert base* to derived*
    cout << "derived* dp2 = &base_obj;  // COMPILATION ERROR\n";
    
    // 5. Accessing derived members through base pointer - NOT ALLOWED
    // bp->sety(600);          // ERROR: base class has no member sety
    // bp->show_derived();     // ERROR: base class has no member show_derived
    cout << "bp->sety(600);  // COMPILATION ERROR\n";
    cout << "bp->show_derived();  // COMPILATION ERROR\n";
    
    cout << "\n=== WORKAROUND WITH CASTING (NOT RECOMMENDED) ===\n";
    
    // 6. Unsafe casting demonstration
    derived* unsafe_dp = (derived*)&b_obj;  // Compiles but dangerous!
    unsafe_dp->setx(700);  // This works (inherited member)
    cout << "After unsafe cast, x = " << unsafe_dp->getx() << "\n";
    
    // unsafe_dp->sety(800);   // DANGEROUS! base object has no y member
    // cout << "y = " << unsafe_dp->gety() << "\n";  // UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR!
    cout << "unsafe_dp->sety(800);  // WOULD CAUSE UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR\n";
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### Exercise Output
```
=== VALID OPERATIONS ===
Base ptr->Base obj: x = 100
Base ptr->Derived obj: x = 200
Direct access to y = 300
Derived ptr->Derived obj: x = 400, y = 500

=== INVALID OPERATIONS (COMMENTED) ===
derived* dp2 = &base_obj;  // COMPILATION ERROR
bp->sety(600);  // COMPILATION ERROR
bp->show_derived();  // COMPILATION ERROR

=== WORKAROUND WITH CASTING (NOT RECOMMENDED) ===
After unsafe cast, x = 700
unsafe_dp->sety(800);  // WOULD CAUSE UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR
```

}
```

## Best Practices

### Do's
1. **Use base pointers for polymorphism**: Essential for virtual function calls
2. **Access inherited members only**: Through base pointers
3. **Prefer direct access**: For derived-specific members
4. **Check object validity**: Before casting operations

### Don'ts
1. **Don't cast unnecessarily**: Avoid `(derived*)base_ptr` unless absolutely needed
2. **Don't rely on pointer arithmetic**: With base pointers to derived objects
3. **Don't access derived members**: Through base pointers directly
4. **Don't assume type safety**: When casting pointers

---

## Summary

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Upward Compatibility**: Base pointers can point to derived objects safely
2. **Limited Access**: Base pointers can only access inherited members
3. **Foundation for Polymorphism**: This feature enables virtual function mechanisms
4. **Memory Safety**: Prevents access to non-existent members automatically
5. **Pointer Arithmetic Caution**: Operates on declared type, not actual object type

This concept forms the foundation for understanding virtual functions and polymorphism in the next sections. The ability to use base pointers with derived objects is what makes C++ object-oriented programming so powerful and flexible.
