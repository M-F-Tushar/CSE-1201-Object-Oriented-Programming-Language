# 10.3 MORE ABOUT VIRTUAL FUNCTIONS

## Overview

Virtual functions in C++ sometimes don't have meaningful operations to perform in the base class. This commonly occurs when a base class serves as a foundation, providing core functionality while derived classes supply the complete implementation. In such cases, C++ provides **pure virtual functions** to ensure derived classes implement their own versions.

## Pure Virtual Functions

### Definition and Syntax

A **pure virtual function** has no definition in the base class - only its prototype exists. The syntax is:

```cpp
virtual type func_name(parameter_list) = 0;
```

The key element is `= 0`, which tells the compiler that no function body exists for this function in the base class.

### Key Characteristics

- **Forces Override**: Any derived class **must** override pure virtual functions
- **Compile-time Error**: If a derived class doesn't override a pure virtual function, compilation fails
- **Guarantees Implementation**: Ensures derived classes provide their own definitions

## Abstract Classes

### Definition

When a class contains **at least one pure virtual function**, it becomes an **abstract class**.

### Properties of Abstract Classes

- **Incomplete Type**: Cannot create objects of abstract classes
- **Inheritance Only**: Exist solely to be inherited by other classes
- **Pointer Creation Allowed**: You can still create pointers to abstract classes (essential for polymorphism)
- **Reference Allowed**: References to abstract classes are also permitted

## Virtual Function Inheritance

Virtual functions maintain their virtual nature when inherited through multiple levels of inheritance. This means:

- If class B has virtual function f()
- Class D1 inherits from B
- Class D2 inherits from D1
- Both D1 and D2 can override f()

## Examples

### Example 1: Abstract Class with Pure Virtual Function

This example demonstrates an improved version using pure virtual functions to ensure derived classes implement `getarea()`:

```cpp
// Create an abstract class
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class area
{
    double dim1, dim2;  // dimensions of figure
public:
    void setarea(double d1, double d2)
    {
        dim1 = d1;
        dim2 = d2;
    }
    
    void getdim(double &d1, double &d2)
    {
        d1 = dim1;
        d2 = dim2;
    }
    
    virtual double getarea() = 0;  // pure virtual function
};

class rectangle : public area
{
public:
    double getarea()
    {
        double d1, d2;
        getdim(d1, d2);
        return d1 * d2;
    }
};

class triangle : public area
{
public:
    double getarea()
    {
        double d1, d2;
        getdim(d1, d2);
        return 0.5 * d1 * d2;
    }
};

int main()
{
    area *p;
    rectangle r;
    triangle t;
    
    r.setarea(3.3, 4.5);
    t.setarea(4.0, 5.0);
    
    p = &r;
    cout << "Rectangle has area: " << p->getarea() << '\n';
    
    p = &t;
    cout << "Triangle has area: " << p->getarea() << '\n';
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The `area` class is now abstract because `getarea()` is pure virtual
- Both `rectangle` and `triangle` **must** implement `getarea()`
- You cannot create objects of type `area` directly
- Polymorphism works through the base class pointer `p`
- **Output:**
  ```
  Rectangle has area: 14.85
  Triangle has area: 10
  ```

### Example 2: Virtual Function Inheritance Hierarchy

This example shows how virtual nature is preserved across multiple inheritance levels:

```cpp
// Virtual functions retain their virtual nature when inherited
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base
{
public:
    virtual void func()
    {
        cout << "Using base version of func()\n";
    }
};

class derived1 : public base
{
public:
    void func()
    {
        cout << "Using derived1's version of func()\n";
    }
};

// derived2 inherits derived1
class derived2 : public derived1
{
public:
    void func()
    {
        cout << "Using derived2's version of func()\n";
    }
};

int main()
{
    base *p;
    base ob;
    derived1 d_ob1;
    derived2 d_ob2;
    
    p = &ob;
    p->func();     // use base's func()
    
    p = &d_ob1;
    p->func();     // use derived1's func()
    
    p = &d_ob2;
    p->func();     // use derived2's func()
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `func()` is virtual in `base` class
- `derived1` inherits and overrides `func()`
- `derived2` inherits from `derived1` and also overrides `func()`
- Each call through the base pointer invokes the appropriate derived version
- **Output:**
  ```
  Using base version of func()
  Using derived1's version of func()
  Using derived2's version of func()
  ```

**Hierarchical Behavior:**
- If `derived2` didn't override `func()`, it would use `derived1`'s version
- If neither `derived1` nor `derived2` overrode `func()`, all calls would use `base`'s version

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Experimenting with Abstract Classes

**Task:** Try creating an object using the `area` class from Example 1 and observe the error message. Also, in Example 2, remove the redefinition of `func()` within `derived2` and confirm that `derived1`'s version is used.

**Solution and Expected Results:**

**Part A - Creating Abstract Class Object:**
```cpp
// This will cause a compile-time error:
area a;  // ERROR!
```
**Error Message:** Something like "Cannot instantiate abstract class" or "object of abstract class type is not allowed"

**Part B - Removing derived2's func():**
```cpp
class derived2 : public derived1
{
    // func() removed - will use derived1's version
};
```
**Result:** The program compiles and runs, outputting:
```
Using base version of func()
Using derived1's version of func()
Using derived1's version of func()  // Note: derived1's version used for d_ob2
```

### Exercise 2: Why Abstract Classes Cannot Be Instantiated

**Question:** Why can't an object be created using an abstract class?

**Answer:** Abstract classes cannot be instantiated because they are **incomplete types**. Since they contain at least one pure virtual function (with no implementation), the class definition is incomplete. The compiler cannot create objects of a type that has undefined functions, as it wouldn't know what code to execute when those functions are called.

### Exercise 3: Removing Only derived1's func()

**Question:** In Example 2, what happens if you remove only the redefinition of `func()` inside `derived1`? Does the program still compile and run?

**Modified Code:**
```cpp
class derived1 : public base
{
    // func() removed - will use base's version
};

class derived2 : public derived1
{
public:
    void func()
    {
        cout << "Using derived2's version of func()\n";
    }
};
```

**Answer:** Yes, the program still compiles and runs perfectly. The output would be:
```
Using base version of func()
Using base version of func()        // derived1 uses base's version
Using derived2's version of func()
```

**Explanation:** This works because:
- `derived1` inherits `base`'s virtual `func()` but doesn't override it
- `derived2` inherits from `derived1` but provides its own override
- Virtual function resolution finds the most derived implementation available
- For `d_ob1`, since `derived1` has no override, `base`'s version is used
- For `d_ob2`, `derived2`'s override is used

## Key Takeaways

1. **Pure Virtual Functions** ensure derived classes provide implementations
2. **Abstract Classes** cannot be instantiated but can have pointers/references
3. **Virtual Nature** is preserved through inheritance hierarchies
4. **Polymorphism** works through base class pointers regardless of inheritance depth
5. **Compile-time Safety** prevents creation of incomplete object types
