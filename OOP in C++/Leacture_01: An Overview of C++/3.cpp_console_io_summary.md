# Chapter 1.3: C++ Console I/O - Structured Summary

## 1. Introduction to C++ I/O

### C++ as a Superset of C
- C++ contains all elements of the C language
- All C programs are also C++ programs by default (with minor exceptions)
- You can write C++ programs that look like C programs
- However, to get maximum benefit from C++, you should use C++ style programming

### The Most Common C++ Feature
The most commonly used C++ specific feature is its approach to console I/O, which differs significantly from C's approach.

## 2. C++ I/O Operators vs C I/O Functions

### Traditional C Approach
```c
printf("Hello World\n");
scanf("%d", &number);
```

### C++ Approach
```cpp
cout << "Hello World\n";
cin >> number;
```

### Key Differences
- **C++**: Uses I/O operators instead of I/O functions
- **Output operator**: `<<` (left shift operator repurposed)
- **Input operator**: `>>` (right shift operator repurposed)
- **Note**: These operators still retain their original meanings (left and right shift) but also perform I/O operations

## 3. Output Operations with `cout`

### What is `cout`?
- `cout` is a predefined stream
- Automatically linked to the console when a C++ program begins execution
- Similar to C's `stdout`
- Console I/O may be redirected (like in C)

### Basic Output Syntax
```cpp
cout << expression;
```

### Simple Output Examples
```cpp
cout << "This string is output to the screen.\n";
cout << 100.99;
cout << variable_name;
```

## 4. Input Operations with `cin`

### What is `cin`?
- `cin` is the standard input stream
- Used to read input from the keyboard
- Similar to C's `stdin`

### Basic Input Syntax
```cpp
cin >> variable;
```

### Key Difference from C
```cpp
// C style - requires address operator
scanf("%d", &num);

// C++ style - no address operator needed
cin >> num;
```

**Important**: Notice that `num` is not preceded by `&`. This is because C++'s input operator works differently than C's `scanf()` function.

## 5. Required Header

To use C++ I/O operators, you must include:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

This is one of C++'s standard headers supplied by your C++ compiler.

## 6. Complete Examples with Explanations

### Example 1: Basic Output Program
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int i, j;
    double d;
    
    i = 10;
    j = 20;
    d = 99.101;
    
    cout << "Here are some values: ";
    cout << i;
    cout << ' ';
    cout << j;
    cout << ' ';
    cout << d;
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Here are some values: 10 20 99.101
```

**Explanation:**
- Each `cout` statement outputs one item
- Spaces must be explicitly included between items
- Variables of different types (int, double) can be output using the same operator

### Example 2: Efficient Multiple Output
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int i, j;
    double d;
    
    i = 10;
    j = 20;
    d = 99.101;
    
    cout << "Here are some values: ";
    cout << i << ' ' << j << ' ' << d;
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Key Points:**
- Multiple items can be output in a single statement
- The `<<` operator can be part of an arbitrarily long expression
- Spaces must be explicitly included: `' '`
- More efficient than multiple separate `cout` statements

### Example 3: Simple Input Program
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int i;
    
    cout << "Enter a value: ";
    cin >> i;
    cout << "Here's your number: " << i << "\n";
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Sample Run:**
```
Enter a value: 100
Here's your number: 100
```

**Explanation:**
- Program prompts user for input
- `cin >> i` reads the integer value entered by user
- Value is stored in variable `i`
- Combined output statement displays the result

### Example 4: Multiple Input Items
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int i;
    float f;
    char s[80];
    
    cout << "Enter an integer, float, and string: ";
    cin >> i >> f >> s;
    cout << "Here's your data: ";
    cout << i << ' ' << f << ' ' << s;
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Sample Input:**
```
10 100.12 This is a test
```

**Sample Output:**
```
10 100.12 This
```

**Important Notes:**
- Multiple items can be input in one statement
- Individual data items must be separated by whitespace (spaces, tabs, or newlines)
- When reading strings, input stops at the first whitespace character
- In the example, only "This" is read; "is a test" remains in the input buffer

### Example 5: Line-Buffered Input
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    char ch;
    
    cout << "Enter keys, x to stop.\n";
    do
    {
        cout << ": ";
        cin >> ch;
    }
    while (ch != 'x');
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- Demonstrates line-buffered input behavior
- No information is passed to the program until ENTER is pressed
- Similar to C's `scanf()` function behavior
- You must press ENTER after each key for the character to be sent to the program

## 7. Important Concepts

### Operator Overloading
- The expanded roles of `<<` and `>>` are examples of operator overloading
- These operators retain their original meanings (bitwise shift) but also perform I/O
- This is a key feature of C++ that allows operators to have multiple meanings based on context

### Whitespace Handling
- Input operations skip leading whitespace
- Individual data items must be separated by whitespace
- String input stops at first whitespace character

### Line Buffering
- Input is line-buffered by default
- Information is not passed to the program until ENTER is pressed
- Similar to C's `scanf()` behavior

## 8. Compatibility Notes

### For Older Compilers
If your compiler doesn't support new-style headers, replace:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
```

With:
```cpp
#include <iostream.h>
```

## 9. Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Employee Pay Calculator
Write a program that inputs the number of hours an employee works and the employee's wage, then displays the employee's gross pay. (Be sure to prompt for input.)

**Solution Structure:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    double hours, wage, grossPay;
    
    cout << "Enter hours worked: ";
    cin >> hours;
    cout << "Enter hourly wage: ";
    cin >> wage;
    
    grossPay = hours * wage;
    
    cout << "Gross pay: $" << grossPay << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Exercise 2: Feet to Inches Converter
Write a program that converts feet to inches. Prompt the user for feet and display the equivalent number of inches. Have your program repeat this process until the user enters 0 for the number of feet.

**Solution Structure:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    double feet;
    
    do
    {
        cout << "Enter feet (0 to quit): ";
        cin >> feet;
        
        if (feet != 0)
        {
            cout << feet << " feet = " << (feet * 12) << " inches\n";
        }
    }
    while (feet != 0);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Exercise 3: Convert C Program to C++ Style
**Original C Program:**
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int a, b, d, min;
    
    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%d%d", &a, &b);
    min = a > b ? b : a;
    for (d = 2; d < min; d++)
        if (((a % d) == 0) && ((b % d) == 0))
            break;
    if (d == min)
    {
        printf("No common denominators\n");
        return 0;
    }
    printf("The lowest common denominator is %d\n", d);
    return 0;
}
```

**C++ Style Version:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int a, b, d, min;
    
    cout << "Enter two numbers: ";
    cin >> a >> b;
    min = a > b ? b : a;
    for (d = 2; d < min; d++)
        if (((a % d) == 0) && ((b % d) == 0))
            break;
    if (d == min)
    {
        cout << "No common denominators\n";
        return 0;
    }
    cout << "The lowest common denominator is " << d << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

**Key Changes:**
- `#include <stdio.h>` → `#include <iostream>`
- Added `using namespace std;`
- `printf()` → `cout <<`
- `scanf("%d%d", &a, &b)` → `cin >> a >> b` (note: no `&` needed)

## 10. Summary

C++ console I/O provides a more intuitive and type-safe approach to input and output operations compared to C. The key advantages include:

- **Simpler syntax**: No format specifiers needed
- **Type safety**: Compiler automatically handles different data types
- **No address operators**: Input operations don't require `&` for variables
- **Operator overloading**: Same operators work for different data types
- **Chaining**: Multiple operations can be chained in a single statement

Understanding C++ I/O is fundamental to writing effective C++ programs and represents one of the most visible differences between C and C++ programming styles.
