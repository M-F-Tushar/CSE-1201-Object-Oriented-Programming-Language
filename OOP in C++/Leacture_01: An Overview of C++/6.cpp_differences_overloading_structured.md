# 1.6 Some Differences Between C and C++

## Overview
Although C++ is a superset of C, there are some small differences between the two, and a few are worth knowing from the start. Before proceeding, let's take time to examine them.

## Key Differences

### 1. Empty Parameter Lists
**In C:**
```c
char f1(void);  // void is required for empty parameter list
```

**In C++:**
```cpp
char f1();      // void is optional
char f1(void);  // also valid but redundant
```

- In C++, the `void` is optional for empty parameter lists
- C++ programmers rarely use `void` for empty parameter lists due to efficiency considerations
- Both declarations are equivalent in C++

### 2. Function Prototypes
**In C:**
- Prototypes are recommended but technically optional

**In C++:**
- **All functions must be prototyped** (required)
- A member function's prototype contained in a class also serves as its general prototype
- No separate prototype is required for member functions

### 3. Return Values
**In C:**
- Non-void functions are not required to actually return a value
- If no value is returned, a garbage value is "returned"

**In C++:**
- **If a function is declared as returning a value, it must return a value**
- Any return statement within a non-void function must contain a value

### 4. Default Return Types
**In C:**
- If you don't explicitly specify the return type, integer return type is assumed

**In C++:**
- Has dropped the "default-to-int" rule
- **You must explicitly declare the return type of all functions**

### 5. Local Variable Declaration
**In C:**
- Local variables can be declared only at the start of a block
- Must be declared prior to any "action" statements

**In C++:**
- **Local variables can be declared anywhere within a block**
- Can be declared close to where they are first used
- Helps prevent unwanted side effects

### 6. Boolean Data Type
**C++** defines the `bool` data type:
- Used to store Boolean (true/false) values
- Defines keywords `true` and `false`
- Only values that a `bool` type can have
- Outcome of relational and logical operators is a `bool` value
- All conditional statements must evaluate to a `bool` value

**Automatic Conversions:**
- Any nonzero value is automatically converted to `true`
- Zero is converted to `false`
- `true` is converted to 1 in integer expressions
- `false` is converted to 0 in integer expressions

## Examples

### Example 1: Empty Parameter Lists
In a C program, it is common practice to declare `main()` as shown here if it takes no command-line arguments:
```c
int main(void)
```

However, in C++, the use of `void` is redundant and unnecessary:
```cpp
int main()  // Preferred in C++
```

### Example 2: Function Prototypes Required
This short C++ program will not compile because the function `sum()` is not prototyped:

```cpp
// This program will not compile
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int a, b, c;
    cout << "Enter two numbers: ";
    cin >> a >> b;
    c = sum(a, b);  // ERROR: sum() not prototyped
    cout << "Sum is: " << c;
    return 0;
}

// This function needs a prototype
sum(int a, int b)  // Missing return type and prototype
{
    return a + b;
}
```

### Example 3: Local Variables Declared Anywhere
This program illustrates how local variables can be declared anywhere within a block:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int i; // local var declared at start of block
    cout << "Enter number: ";
    cin >> i;
    
    // compute factorial
    int j, fact = 1; // vars declared after action statement
    for(j = i; j >= 1; j--)
        fact = fact * j;
    
    cout << "Factorial is " << fact;
    return 0;
}
```

The declaration of `j` and `fact` near the point of first use is of little value in this short example; however, in large functions, the ability to declare variables close to the point of their first use can help clarify your code and prevent unintentional side effects.

### Example 4: Boolean Data Type
The following program creates a Boolean variable called `outcome` and assigns it the value `false`. It then uses this variable in an `if` statement:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    bool outcome;
    outcome = false;
    
    if(outcome)
        cout << "true";
    else
        cout << "false";
    
    return 0;
}
```

As you should expect, the program displays `false`.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1
The following program will not compile as a C++ program. Why not?

```cpp
// This program has an error.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    f();  // ERROR: f() not prototyped
    return 0;
}

void f()
{
    cout << "this won't work";
}
```

### Exercise 2
On your own, try declaring local variables at various points in a C++ program. Try the same in a C program, paying attention to which declarations generate errors.

# 1.7 Introducing Function Overloading

## Overview
After classes, perhaps the next most important and pervasive C++ feature is function overloading. Not only does function overloading provide the mechanism by which C++ achieves one type of polymorphism, it also forms the basis by which the C++ programming environment can be dynamically extended.

## What is Function Overloading?
In C++, two or more functions can share the same name as long as either:
- The **type** of their arguments differs, or
- The **number** of their arguments differs, or
- **Both** type and number differ

When two or more functions share the same name, they are said to be **overloaded**.

## Benefits of Function Overloading
- Helps reduce the complexity of a program
- Allows related operations to be referred to by the same name
- Achieves compile-time polymorphism
- Embodies the philosophy of "one interface, many methods"

## How to Overload Functions
It is very easy to overload a function:
1. Simply declare and define all required versions
2. The compiler will automatically select the correct version based upon the number and/or type of the arguments used to call the function

**Note:** It is also possible in C++ to overload operators. However, before you can fully understand operator overloading, you will need to know more about C++.

## Examples

### Example 1: Overloading for Different Data Types
One of the main uses for function overloading is to achieve compile-time polymorphism. The classic example is found in the C standard library, which contains the functions `abs()`, `labs()`, and `fabs()`, which return the absolute value of an integer, a long integer, and a floating-point value, respectively.

In C++, you can correct this situation by overloading one name for the three types of data:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Overload abs() three ways
int abs(int n);
long abs(long n);
double abs(double n);

int main()
{
    cout << "Absolute value of -10: " << abs(-10) << "\n\n";
    cout << "Absolute value of -10L: " << abs(-10L) << "\n\n";
    cout << "Absolute value of -10.01: " << abs(-10.01) << "\n\n";
    return 0;
}

// abs() for ints
int abs(int n)
{
    cout << "In integer abs()\n";
    return n < 0 ? -n : n;
}

// abs() for longs
long abs(long n)
{
    cout << "In long abs()\n";
    return n < 0 ? -n : n;
}

// abs() for doubles
double abs(double n)
{
    cout << "In double abs()\n";
    return n < 0 ? -n : n;
}
```

**Output:**
```
In integer abs()
Absolute value of -10: 10

In long abs()
Absolute value of -10L: 10

In double abs()
Absolute value of -10.01: 10.01
```

This example illustrates the value of function overloading. Because a single name can be used to describe a general class of action, the artificial complexity caused by three slightly different names is eliminated. You now must remember only one nameâ€”the one that describes the general action. Through the use of polymorphism, three names have been reduced to one.

### Example 2: Overloading with Different Parameter Types
Here is another example of function overloading. In this case, the function `date()` is overloaded to accept the date either as a string or as three integers:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void date(char *date);  // date as a string
void date(int month, int day, int year);  // date as numbers

int main()
{
    date("8/23/99");
    date(8, 23, 99);
    return 0;
}

// Date as string
void date(char *date)
{
    cout << "Date: " << date << "\n";
}

// Date as integers
void date(int month, int day, int year)
{
    cout << "Date: " << month << "/";
    cout << day << "/" << year << "\n";
}
```

This example illustrates how function overloading can provide the most natural interface to a function. Since it is very common for the date to be represented as either a string or as three integers containing the month, day, and year, you are free to select the most convenient form relative to the situation at hand.

### Example 3: Overloading with Different Number of Arguments
Overloaded functions can also differ in the number of arguments:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void f1(int a);
void f1(int a, int b);

int main()
{
    f1(10);
    f1(10, 20);
    return 0;
}

void f1(int a)
{
    cout << "In f1(int a)\n";
}

void f1(int a, int b)
{
    cout << "In f1(int a, int b)\n";
}
```

### Example 4: Invalid Overloading (Return Type Only)
It is important to understand that the return type alone is not a sufficient difference to allow function overloading. If two functions differ only in the type of data they return, the compiler will not always be able to select the proper one to call:

```cpp
// This is incorrect and will not compile
int f1(int a);
double f1(int a);
...
f1(10); // which function does the compiler call???
```

As the comment indicates, the compiler has no way of knowing which version of `f1()` to call.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1
Create a function called `sroot()` that returns the square root of its argument. Overload `sroot()` three ways: have it return the square root of an integer, a long integer, and a double. (To actually compute the square root, you can use the standard library function `sqrt()`.)

### Exercise 2
The C++ standard library contains these three functions:
```cpp
double atof(const char *s);
int atoi(const char *s);
long atol(const char *s);
```

These functions return the numeric value contained in the string pointed to by `s`. Specifically, `atof()` returns a double, `atoi()` returns an integer, and `atol()` returns a long. Why is it not possible to overload these functions?

### Exercise 3
Create a function called `min()` that returns the smaller of the two numeric arguments used to call the function. Overload `min()` so it accepts characters, integers, and doubles as arguments.

### Exercise 4
Create a function called `sleep()` that pauses the computer for the number of seconds specified by its single argument. Overload `sleep()` so it can be called with either an integer or a string representation of an integer. For example, both of these calls to `sleep()` will cause the computer to pause for 10 seconds:

```cpp
sleep(10);
sleep("10");
```

Demonstrate that your functions work by including them in a short program. (Feel free to use a delay loop to pause the computer.)

## Key Concepts Summary

### C++ vs C Differences:
1. **Empty parameter lists**: `void` is optional in C++
2. **Function prototypes**: Required in C++, optional in C
3. **Return values**: Must return a value if declared non-void in C++
4. **Default return types**: Must explicitly declare return types in C++
5. **Local variables**: Can be declared anywhere in C++
6. **Boolean type**: `bool` data type with `true`/`false` keywords

### Function Overloading:
1. **Same name, different parameters**: Functions can share names if parameters differ
2. **Automatic selection**: Compiler selects appropriate version based on arguments
3. **Polymorphism**: Achieves "one interface, many methods"
4. **Return type alone**: Not sufficient for overloading
5. **Reduces complexity**: Eliminates need for multiple similar function names
