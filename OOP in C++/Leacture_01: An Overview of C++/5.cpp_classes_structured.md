# 1.5 Classes: A First Look

## Overview
Perhaps the single most important feature of C++ is the class. The class is the mechanism that is used to create objects. As such, the class is at the heart of many C++ features. Although the subject of classes is covered in great detail throughout this book, classes are so fundamental to C++ programming that a brief overview is necessary here.

## Class Declaration Syntax
A class is declared using the `class` keyword. The syntax of a class declaration is similar to that of a structure.

### General Form
```cpp
class class_name
{
    // private functions and variables
public:
    // public functions and variables
} object_list;
```

### Key Components
- **object_list**: Optional - you can declare class objects later, as needed
- **class_name**: Technically optional, but virtually always needed as it becomes a new type name used to declare objects of the class

## Class Members
Functions and variables declared inside a class declaration are said to be **members** of that class.

### Access Specifiers
- **Private (default)**: All functions and variables declared inside a class are private by default
  - Accessible only by other members of that class
- **Public**: Declared using the `public` keyword followed by a colon
  - Accessible by other members of the class and by any other part of the program that contains the class

### Simple Class Example
```cpp
class myclass
{
    // private to myclass
    int a;
public:
    void set_a(int num);
    int get_a();
};
```

This class has:
- One private variable: `a`
- Two public functions: `set_a()` and `get_a()`
- Functions are declared within a class using their prototype forms
- Functions that are declared to be part of a class are called **member functions**

## Member Function Definition
To define a member function, you must link the type name of the class with the name of the function using the **scope resolution operator** (`::`).

### Syntax
```cpp
ret_type class_name::func_name(parameter_list)
{
    // body of function
}
```

### Example Implementation
```cpp
void myclass::set_a(int num)
{
    a = num;
}

int myclass::get_a()
{
    return a;
}
```

Notice that both `set_a()` and `get_a()` have access to `a`, which is private to `myclass`. Because they are members of `myclass`, they can directly access its private data.

## Object Creation and Usage
The declaration of `myclass` did not define any objects of type `myclass` - it only defines the type of object that will be created when one is actually declared.

### Creating Objects
```cpp
myclass ob1, ob2; // these are objects of type myclass
```

### Key Concept
**Remember**: A class declaration is a logical abstraction that defines a new type. It determines what an object of that type will look like. An object declaration creates a physical entity of that type. That is, an object occupies memory space, but a type definition does not.

### Accessing Public Members
Once an object of a class has been created, your program can reference its public members by using the dot (period) operator in much the same way that structure members are accessed.

```cpp
ob1.set_a(10); // sets ob1's version of a to 10
ob2.set_a(99); // sets ob2's version of a to 99
```

### Important Note
**Remember**: Each object of a class has its own copy of every variable declared within the class. This means that `ob1`'s `a` is distinct and different from the `a` linked to `ob2`.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Class Demonstration
This program demonstrates `myclass`, described in the text. It sets the value of `a` of `ob1` and `ob2` and then displays `a`'s value for each object:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class myclass
{
    // private to myclass
    int a;
public:
    void set_a(int num);
    int get_a();
};

void myclass::set_a(int num)
{
    a = num;
}

int myclass::get_a()
{
    return a;
}

int main()
{
    myclass ob1, ob2;
    
    ob1.set_a(10);
    ob2.set_a(99);
    
    cout << ob1.get_a() << "\n";
    cout << ob2.get_a() << "\n";
    
    return 0;
}
```

As you should expect, this program displays the values 10 and 99 on the screen.

### Example 2: Accessing Private Members (Error Example)
In `myclass` from the preceding example, `a` is private. This means that only member functions of `myclass` can access it directly. If you try to access a private member of a class from some part of your program that is not a member of that class, a compile-time error will result.

```cpp
// This fragment contains an error
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    myclass ob1, ob2;
    
    ob1.a = 10; // ERROR! cannot access private member
    ob2.a = 99; // by non-member functions.
    
    cout << ob1.get_a() << "\n";
    cout << ob2.get_a() << "\n";
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Example 3: Public Member Variables
Just as there can be public member functions, there can be public member variables as well. For example, if `a` were declared in the public section of `myclass`, `a` could be referenced by any part of the program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class myclass
{
public:
    // now a is public
    int a;
    // and there is no need for set_a() or get_a()
};

int main()
{
    myclass ob1, ob2;
    
    // here a is accessed directly
    ob1.a = 10;
    ob2.a = 99;
    
    cout << ob1.a << "\n";
    cout << ob2.a << "\n";
    
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, since `a` is declared as a public member of `myclass`, it is directly accessible from `main()`. Notice how the dot operator is used to access `a`. In general, when you are calling a member function or accessing a member variable from outside its class, the object's name followed by the dot operator followed by the member's name is required to fully specify which object's member you are referring to.

### Example 4: Stack Class Implementation
To get a taste of the power of objects, let's look at a more practical example. This program creates a class called `stack` that implements a stack that can be used to store characters:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#define SIZE 10

// Declare a stack class for characters
class stack
{
    char stck[SIZE]; // holds the stack
    int tos;         // index of top of stack
public:
    void init();         // initialize stack
    void push(char ch);  // push character on stack
    char pop();          // pop character from stack
};

// Initialize the stack
void stack::init()
{
    tos = 0;
}

// Push a character
void stack::push(char ch)
{
    if(tos == SIZE)
    {
        cout << "Stack is full";
        return;
    }
    stck[tos] = ch;
    tos++;
}

// Pop a character
char stack::pop()
{
    if(tos == 0)
    {
        cout << "Stack is empty";
        return 0; // return null on empty stack
    }
    tos--;
    return stck[tos];
}

int main()
{
    stack s1, s2; // create two stacks
    int i;
    
    // initialize the stacks
    s1.init();
    s2.init();
    
    s1.push('a');
    s2.push('x');
    s1.push('b');
    s2.push('y');
    s1.push('c');
    s2.push('z');
    
    for(i = 0; i < 3; i++)
        cout << "Pop s1: " << s1.pop() << "\n";
    for(i = 0; i < 3; i++)
        cout << "Pop s2: " << s2.pop() << "\n";
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Pop s1: c
Pop s1: b
Pop s1: a
Pop s2: z
Pop s2: y
Pop s2: x
```

#### Analysis of Stack Example
The class `stack` contains two private variables:
- **stck**: Array that actually holds the characters pushed onto the stack
- **tos**: Contains the index to the top of the stack

The public stack functions are:
- **init()**: Initialize the stack
- **push()**: Push a value onto the stack
- **pop()**: Pop a value from the stack

Inside `main()`, two stacks, `s1` and `s2`, are created, and three characters are pushed onto each stack. It is important to understand that each stack object is separate from the other. That is, the characters pushed onto `s1` in no way affect the characters pushed onto `s2`. Each object contains its own copy of `stck` and `tos`. This concept is fundamental to understanding objects. Although all objects of a class share their member functions, each object creates and maintains its own data.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1
If you have not done so, enter and run the programs shown in the examples for this section.

### Exercise 2
Create a class called `card` that maintains a library card catalog entry. Have the class store a book's title, author, and number of copies on hand. Store the title and author as strings and the number on hand as an integer. Use a public member function called `store()` to store a book's information and a public member function called `show()` to display the information. Include a short `main()` function to demonstrate the class.

### Exercise 3
Create a queue class that maintains a circular queue of integers. Make the queue size 100 integers long. Include a short `main()` function that demonstrates its operation.

## Key Concepts Summary

2. **Members** can be either private (default) or public
3. **Member functions** are defined using the scope resolution operator (`::`)
4. **Objects** are instances of classes that occupy memory
5. **Each object** has its own copy of all class variables
6. **Access** to public members is done using the dot operator (`.`)
7. **Private members** can only be accessed by other members of the same class
