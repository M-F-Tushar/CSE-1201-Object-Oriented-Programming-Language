# 1.4 C++ Comments

## Overview
In C++, you can include comments in your program using two different methods:

## 1. C-Style Comments (Multiline Comments)
- **Syntax**: Begin with `/*` and end with `*/`
- **Characteristics**:
  - Standard C-like comment mechanism
  - Cannot be nested in C++
  - Used for multiline commentaries
- **Best Practice**: Typically used by C++ programmers for longer, multiline explanations

## 2. Single-Line Comments
- **Syntax**: Begin with `//` and continue to the end of the line
- **Characteristics**:
  - Stops at the physical end of the line (carriage-return/linefeed combination)
  - No comment terminator symbol needed
  - C++-specific feature
- **Best Practice**: Reserved for short remarks and brief explanations

## Examples

### Example 1: Program with Both Comment Types
```cpp
/* This is a C-like comment.
   This program determines whether an integer is odd or even */
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int num; // this is a C++ single-line comment
    
    // read the number
    cout << "Enter number to be tested: ";
    cin >> num;
    
    // see if even or odd
    if ((num % 2) == 0)
        cout << "Number is even\n";
    else
        cout << "Number is odd\n";
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Example 2: Nesting Single-Line Comments in Multiline Comments
```cpp
/* This is a multiline comment
   inside of which // is nested a single-line comment.
   Here is the end of the multiline comment. */
```

**Note**: While multiline comments cannot be nested, it is possible to nest a single-line comment within a multiline comment.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1
**Question**: As an experiment, determine whether this comment (which nests a C-like comment within a C++-style, single-line comment) is valid:
```cpp
// This is a strange /* way to do a comment */
```

### Exercise 2
**Task**: On your own, add comments to the answers to the exercises in Section 1.3.

## Key Points to Remember
1. **C-style comments** (`/* */`) are used for multiline explanations
2. **Single-line comments** (`//`) are used for brief remarks
3. **Nesting rules**: 
   - C-style comments cannot be nested within each other
   - Single-line comments can be nested within C-style comments
   - The reverse nesting (C-style within single-line) needs testing
4. **Best practices**: Use appropriate comment types based on the length and purpose of your comments
