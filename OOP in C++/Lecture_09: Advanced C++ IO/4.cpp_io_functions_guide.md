# C++ Unformatted I/O Functions - Complete Guide

## Overview
This guide covers advanced unformatted I/O functions in C++ that provide more control over input/output operations than the standard `>>` and `<<` operators.

## 1. The get() Function

The `get()` function is overloaded in three commonly used forms:

### 1.1 Form 1: get(char *buf, streamsize num)
```cpp
istream &get(char *buf, streamsize num);
```

**Behavior:**
- Reads characters into the array pointed to by `buf`
- Stops when:
  - `num-1` characters have been read
  - A newline character is found
  - End of file is encountered
- Automatically null-terminates the array
- **Important:** Newline character is NOT extracted from the stream (remains for next operation)

### 1.2 Form 2: get(char *buf, streamsize num, char delim)
```cpp
istream &get(char *buf, streamsize num, char delim);
```

**Behavior:**
- Reads characters into the array pointed to by `buf`
- Stops when:
  - `num-1` characters have been read
  - The delimiter character `delim` is found
  - End of file is encountered
- Automatically null-terminates the array
- **Important:** Delimiter character is NOT extracted from the stream (remains for next operation)

### 1.3 Form 3: get()
```cpp
int get();
```

**Behavior:**
- Returns the next character from the stream as an integer
- Returns `EOF` if end of file is encountered
- Similar to C's `getc()` function

## 2. The getline() Function

The `getline()` function has two overloaded forms:

### 2.1 Form 1: getline(char *buf, streamsize num)
```cpp
istream &getline(char *buf, streamsize num);
```

**Behavior:**
- Reads characters into the array pointed to by `buf`
- Stops when:
  - `num-1` characters have been read
  - A newline character is found
  - End of file is encountered
- Automatically null-terminates the array
- **Key Difference:** Newline character IS extracted from the stream but NOT stored in `buf`

### 2.2 Form 2: getline(char *buf, streamsize num, char delim)
```cpp
istream &getline(char *buf, streamsize num, char delim);
```

**Behavior:**
- Reads characters into the array pointed to by `buf`
- Stops when:
  - `num-1` characters have been read
  - The delimiter character `delim` is found
  - End of file is encountered
- Automatically null-terminates the array
- **Key Difference:** Delimiter character IS extracted from the stream but NOT stored in `buf`

### Key Difference: get() vs getline()
- **get()**: Leaves delimiter in the stream
- **getline()**: Extracts delimiter from the stream but doesn't store it in the buffer

## 3. The peek() Function

```cpp
int peek();
```

**Purpose:** Preview the next character without removing it from the stream

**Behavior:**
- Returns the next character in the stream
- Does NOT remove the character from the stream
- Returns `EOF` if end of file is encountered
- Useful for looking ahead to determine input type

## 4. The putback() Function

```cpp
istream &putback(char c);
```

**Purpose:** Return the last character read back to the stream

**Behavior:**
- Puts character `c` back into the input stream
- `c` should be the last character that was read
- Useful for "unreading" a character when you've read too far

## 5. The flush() Function

```cpp
ostream &flush();
```

**Purpose:** Force immediate writing of buffered output to physical device

**Behavior:**
- Normally, output is stored in an internal buffer
- Buffer is written to disk only when full
- `flush()` forces immediate write before buffer is full
- Useful in adverse environments (frequent power outages, etc.)

## Examples

### Example 1: Reading Strings with Spaces using getline()

**Problem:** The `>>` operator stops at whitespace, making it unsuitable for reading strings with spaces.

**Solution:** Use `getline()` to read entire lines including spaces.

```cpp
// Use getline() to read a string that contains spaces
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    char str[80];
    cout << "Enter your name: ";
    cin.getline(str, 79);
    cout << str << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `getline(str, 79)` reads up to 78 characters (leaving room for null terminator)
- Uses newline as default delimiter
- Behaves like the standard `gets()` function but safer with size limit
- Reads entire line including spaces until Enter is pressed

### Example 2: Dynamic Input Type Detection with peek() and putback()

**Problem:** Sometimes you don't know whether the next input will be a string or integer.

**Solution:** Use `peek()` to look ahead and `putback()` to handle over-reading.

```cpp
// Demonstrate peek()
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <cctype>
#include <cstdlib>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    char ch;
    ofstream out("test", ios::out | ios::binary);
    if (!out) {
        cout << "Cannot open output file.\n";
        return 1;
    }
    
    char str[80], *p;
    out << 123 << " this is a test " << 23;
    out << " Hello there! " << 99 << "sdf" << endl;
    out.close();
    
    ifstream in("test", ios::in | ios::binary);
    if (!in) {
        cout << "Cannot open input file.\n";
        return 1;
    }
    
    do {
        p = str;
        ch = in.peek(); // see what type of char is next
        
        if (isdigit(ch)) {
            while (isdigit(*p = in.get())) // read integer
                p++;
            in.putback(*p); // return char to stream
            *p = '\0'; // null-terminate the string
            cout << "Integer: " << atoi(str);
        }
        else if (isalpha(ch)) {
            while (isalpha(*p = in.get())) // read a string
                p++;
            in.putback(*p);
            *p = '\0';
            cout << "String: " << str;
        }
        else
            in.get(); // ignore
        cout << '\n';
    }
    while (!in.eof());
    
    in.close();
    return 0;
}
```

**Detailed Explanation:**

1. **File Setup:** Creates a test file with mixed integers and strings
2. **peek() Usage:** `ch = in.peek()` looks at the next character without consuming it
3. **Integer Detection:** `isdigit(ch)` checks if next character is a digit
4. **Character-by-Character Reading:** `while (isdigit(*p = in.get()))` reads digits one by one
5. **putback() Usage:** `in.putback(*p)` returns the non-digit character back to stream
6. **String Processing:** Similar logic for alphabetic characters
7. **Cleanup:** Ignores whitespace and other characters

**Output for the example file:**
```
Integer: 123
String: this
String: is
String: a
String: test
Integer: 23
String: Hello
String: there
Integer: 99
String: sdf
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Converting getline() to get()
**Problem:** Rewrite the program in Example 1 so it uses `get()` instead of `getline()`. Does the program function differently?

**Solution:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    char str[80];
    cout << "Enter your name: ";
    cin.get(str, 79);
    cout << str << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

**Functional Differences:**
- **get()**: Leaves the newline character in the input stream
- **getline()**: Extracts the newline character from the input stream
- **Impact**: If you have subsequent input operations, `get()` might cause issues because the newline remains in the stream
- **Recommendation**: Use `cin.ignore()` after `get()` to remove the remaining newline

### Exercise 2: Line-by-Line File Reader
**Problem:** Write a program that reads a text file one line at a time and displays each line on the screen. Use `getline()`.

**Solution:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    ifstream file("input.txt");
    if (!file) {
        cout << "Cannot open file.\n";
        return 1;
    }
    
    char line[256];
    int lineNumber = 1;
    
    while (!file.eof()) {
        file.getline(line, 255);
        if (file.gcount() > 0) { // Check if any characters were read
            cout << "Line " << lineNumber << ": " << line << endl;
            lineNumber++;
        }
    }
    
    file.close();
    return 0;
}
```

**Features:**
- Opens file with error checking
- Reads lines up to 254 characters (plus null terminator)
- Numbers each line for clarity
- Uses `gcount()` to check if characters were actually read
- Properly closes file

### Exercise 3: When to Use flush()
**Problem:** Think about why there may be cases in which a call to `flush()` is appropriate.

**Scenarios where flush() is appropriate:**

1. **Critical Data Operations:**
   ```cpp
   // Ensure important data is written immediately
   logFile << "Critical error occurred at " << timestamp << endl;
   logFile.flush(); // Don't wait for buffer to fill
   ```

2. **Interactive Programs:**
   ```cpp
   // Ensure prompt appears before waiting for input
   cout << "Enter password: ";
   cout.flush(); // Make sure prompt is visible
   cin >> password;
   ```

3. **Progress Indicators:**
   ```cpp
   // Show progress without newlines
   for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
       cout << ".";
       cout.flush(); // Show each dot immediately
       // ... do work ...
   }
   ```

4. **Debugging:**
   ```cpp
   // Ensure debug messages appear immediately
   cout << "About to call risky function...";
   cout.flush(); // See message even if program crashes
   riskyFunction();
   ```

5. **Network/Communication Programs:**
   ```cpp
   // Ensure data is sent immediately over network
   networkStream << message;
   networkStream.flush(); // Don't wait for buffer
   ```

6. **Real-time Systems:**
   - Time-critical applications
   - Systems with frequent power outages
   - Embedded systems with limited memory

**Note:** Excessive use of `flush()` can hurt performance since it bypasses the efficiency of buffering.

## Summary

These unformatted I/O functions provide fine-grained control over input/output operations:

- **get()**: Read without extracting delimiters
- **getline()**: Read and extract delimiters
- **peek()**: Look ahead without consuming
- **putback()**: Return character to stream
- **flush()**: Force immediate output

Understanding these functions is crucial for robust C++ I/O programming, especially when dealing with mixed data types, user input validation, and system-level programming.
