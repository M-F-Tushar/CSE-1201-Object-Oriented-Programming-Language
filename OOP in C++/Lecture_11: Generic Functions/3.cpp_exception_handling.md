# C++ Exception Handling - Complete Guide

## 11.3 Overview

C++ provides a built-in error handling mechanism called **exception handling**. This system allows you to more easily manage and respond to run-time errors that occur during program execution.

### Core Components

Exception handling in C++ is built upon three fundamental keywords:

1. **`try`** - Contains program statements to monitor for exceptions
2. **`catch`** - Handles (catches) exceptions that are thrown
3. **`throw`** - Throws (generates) an exception when an error occurs

### Basic Concept

- **Program statements** that you want to monitor for exceptions are contained in a **try block**
- If an **exception** (error) occurs within the try block, it is **thrown** using `throw`
- The exception is **caught** using `catch` and then processed appropriately

---

## Syntax and Structure

### General Form

```cpp
try {
    // try block - code to monitor for exceptions
}
catch (type1 arg) {
    // catch block for type1 exceptions
}
catch (type2 arg) {
    // catch block for type2 exceptions  
}
catch (type3 arg) {
    // catch block for type3 exceptions
}
// ... additional catch blocks as needed
catch (typeN arg) {
    // catch block for typeN exceptions
}
```

### Key Rules

1. **Try Block Requirements:**
   - Must contain the portion of your program to monitor for errors
   - Can be as specific as a few statements or as broad as the entire `main()` function
   - Any statement that throws an exception must be executed from within a try block
   - Functions called from within a try block can also throw exceptions

2. **Catch Block Behavior:**
   - Must immediately follow the try statement
   - Each catch handles a specific exception type
   - The catch statement used is determined by the exception's data type
   - If the data type specified by a catch matches the exception, that catch executes (all others are bypassed)
   - The `arg` parameter receives the exception value (optional - you can specify only the type)

3. **Throw Statement:**
   ```cpp
   throw exception;
   ```
   - Must be executed from within the try block or any function called from it
   - `exception` is the value being thrown
   - Any type of data can be thrown, including custom classes

### Exception Type Matching

- **Exact Type Match Required:** The exception type must exactly match the catch statement type
- **Multiple Catch Blocks:** You can have multiple catch statements for different exception types
- **Processing Order:** Catch expressions are checked in the order they appear in the program
- **Class Types:** Frequently used as exceptions for more sophisticated error handling

### Unhandled Exceptions

If you throw an exception for which there is no applicable catch statement:
- **Abnormal program termination** might occur
- In **Standard C++** compliant compilers: the `terminate()` function is invoked
- **Default behavior:** `terminate()` calls `abort()` to stop the program
- **Custom termination:** You can specify your own termination handler

## Detailed Examples

### Example 1: Basic Exception Handling

**Purpose:** Demonstrates the fundamental flow of C++ exception handling

```cpp
// A simple exception handling example
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "start\n";
    
    try {  // start a try block
        cout << "Inside try block\n";
        throw 10;  // throw an error
        cout << "This will not execute";  // Never reached
    }
    catch (int i) {  // catch an error
        cout << "Caught One! Number is: ";
        cout << i << "\n";
    }
    
    cout << "end";
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
start
Inside try block
Caught One! Number is: 10
end
```

**Detailed Explanation:**
- The program starts by printing "start"
- Enters the try block and prints "Inside try block"
- **Critical Point:** When `throw 10` executes:
  - An integer exception (value 10) is thrown
  - **Control immediately transfers** to the matching catch block
  - The try block is **terminated** - remaining statements don't execute
  - The `cout` statement after `throw` **never executes**
- The `catch(int i)` block catches the integer exception
- After catch completes, program continues with statements following the catch
- Finally prints "end"

**Key Insight:** Exception handling uses **control transfer**, not function calls. The stack is automatically reset as needed.

### Example 2: Type Mismatch Problem

**Purpose:** Shows what happens when exception type doesn't match catch type

```cpp
// This example will not work
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "start\n";
    
    try {  // start a try block
        cout << "Inside try block\n";
        throw 10;  // throw an int
        cout << "This will not execute";
    }
    catch (double i) {  // won't work for an int exception
        cout << "Caught One! Number is: ";
        cout << i << "\n";
    }
    
    cout << "end";
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
start
Inside try block
Abnormal program termination
```

**Detailed Explanation:**
- The program throws an `int` (value 10)
- The catch block expects a `double`
- **Type mismatch occurs** - no matching catch handler
- Result: **Abnormal program termination**
- The "end" statement never executes
- This demonstrates the importance of **exact type matching**

### Example 3: Exception from External Function

**Purpose:** Shows that exceptions can be thrown from functions called within try blocks

```cpp
/*
Throwing an exception from a function outside
the try block.
*/
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void Xtest(int test) {
    cout << "Inside Xtest, test is: " << test << "\n";
    if(test)
        throw test;  // throw exception if test is non-zero
}

int main() {
    cout << "start\n";
    
    try {  // start a try block
        Xtest(0);  // won't throw (test is 0)
        Xtest(1);  // will throw (test is 1)  
        Xtest(2);  // never reached
    }
    catch (int i) {  // catch an error
        cout << "Caught One! Number is: ";
        cout << i << "\n";
    }
    
    cout << "end";
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
start
Inside Xtest, test is: 0
Inside Xtest, test is: 1
Caught One! Number is: 1
end
```

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **First call** `Xtest(0)`: test is 0 (false), no exception thrown
- **Second call** `Xtest(1)`: test is 1 (true), throws exception with value 1
- **Exception propagation**: Exception thrown in `Xtest()` propagates back to the try block
- **Control transfer**: Immediately jumps to catch block
- **Third call** `Xtest(2)`: **Never executed** due to exception
- This demonstrates that functions called from within try blocks can throw exceptions that are caught by the surrounding catch blocks

### Example 4: Localized Try/Catch in Functions

**Purpose:** Shows how exception handling resets each time a function is called

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// A try/catch can be inside a function other than main()
void Xhandler(int test) {
    try {
        if(test)
            throw test;  // throw if test is non-zero
    }
    catch (int i) {
        cout << "Caught One! Ex. #: " << i << '\n';
    }
    // Function ends here - exception handling resets on next call
}

int main() {
    cout << "start\n";
    Xhandler(1);  // throws and catches 1
    Xhandler(2);  // throws and catches 2  
    Xhandler(0);  // doesn't throw
    Xhandler(3);  // throws and catches 3
    cout << "end";
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
start
Caught One! Ex. #: 1
Caught One! Ex. #: 2
Caught One! Ex. #: 3
end
```

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **Function-level exception handling**: Each function has its own try/catch scope
- **Call 1** `Xhandler(1)`: throws 1, catches 1, function returns normally
- **Call 2** `Xhandler(2)`: throws 2, catches 2, function returns normally
- **Call 3** `Xhandler(0)`: no exception (test is 0), function returns normally
- **Call 4** `Xhandler(3)`: throws 3, catches 3, function returns normally
- **Exception handling reset**: Each function call gets a fresh exception handling context
- **Key insight**: Exception handling is **localized** to function scope

### Example 5: Multiple Exception Types

**Purpose:** Demonstrates handling different types of exceptions with multiple catch blocks

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Different types of exceptions can be caught
void Xhandler(int test) {
    try {
        if(test)
            throw test;           // throw int if non-zero
        else
            throw "Value is zero."; // throw string if zero
    }
    catch (int i) {
        cout << "Caught One! Ex. #: " << i << '\n';
    }
    catch (const char *str) {
        cout << "Caught a string: ";
        cout << str << '\n';
    }
}

int main() {
    cout << "start\n";
    Xhandler(1);  // throws int 1
    Xhandler(2);  // throws int 2
    Xhandler(0);  // throws string
    Xhandler(3);  // throws int 3
    cout << "end";
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
start
Caught One! Ex. #: 1
Caught One! Ex. #: 2
Caught a string: Value is zero
Caught One! Ex. #: 3
end
```

**Detailed Explanation:**
- **Multiple catch blocks**: Two different catch handlers for different types
- **Call 1** `Xhandler(1)`: test=1, throws `int`, caught by `catch(int i)`
- **Call 2** `Xhandler(2)`: test=2, throws `int`, caught by `catch(int i)`  
- **Call 3** `Xhandler(0)`: test=0, throws `const char*`, caught by `catch(const char *str)`
- **Call 4** `Xhandler(3)`: test=3, throws `int`, caught by `catch(int i)`
- **Type-specific handling**: Each catch responds only to its matching type
- **Sequential checking**: Catch expressions are checked in order until a match is found
- **Exclusive execution**: Only the matching catch block executes; others are ignored

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Hands-On Learning
**Task:** Enter, compile, and run all the preceding example programs. Then experiment with them by altering pieces and observing the results.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the practical flow of exception handling
- See how changes affect program behavior
- Build intuition for exception handling mechanisms

**Suggested Experiments:**
1. Change exception values and types
2. Add more catch blocks
3. Remove catch blocks and observe termination
4. Add multiple throw statements in different locations

### Exercise 2: Code Analysis - Missing Try Block
**Question:** What is wrong with this fragment?

```cpp
int main() {
    throw 12.23;
```

**Answer:** 
- **Problem**: The `throw` statement is not enclosed in a `try` block
- **Consequence**: This will cause **abnormal program termination**
- **Explanation**: Every `throw` statement must be executed from within a try block (or from a function called within a try block)
- **Fix**: Wrap the throw in a try block with an appropriate catch handler:

```cpp
int main() {
    try {
        throw 12.23;
    }
    catch (double d) {
        cout << "Caught double: " << d << endl;
    }
}
```

### Exercise 3: Code Analysis - Type Mismatch
**Question:** What is wrong with this fragment?

```cpp
try {
    // ...
    throw 'a';  // throws a char
    // ...
}
catch (char *) {  // expects char pointer
    // ...
}
```

**Answer:**
- **Problem**: **Type mismatch** between thrown exception and catch handler
- **Thrown type**: `char` (single character)
- **Expected type**: `char*` (pointer to char/string)
- **Consequence**: The exception will **not be caught**, leading to abnormal program termination
- **Fix**: Match the types correctly:

```cpp
// Option 1: Catch the char
try {
    throw 'a';
}
catch (char c) {  // matches char type
    // handle char exception
}

// Option 2: Throw a string
try {
    throw "error message";  // throws const char*
}
catch (const char* str) {  // matches string type
    // handle string exception
}
```

### Exercise 4: Unhandled Exceptions
**Question:** What will happen if an exception is thrown for which there is no corresponding catch statement?

**Answer:**
- **Immediate consequence**: **Abnormal program termination**
- **In Standard C++**: The `terminate()` function is automatically invoked
- **Default behavior**: `terminate()` calls `abort()` to stop the program
- **Stack unwinding**: The program stack is unwound, but destructors may not be called properly
- **No recovery**: The program cannot continue execution
- **Prevention**: Always ensure you have appropriate catch blocks for exceptions you might throw, or use a catch-all handler:

```cpp
try {
    // risky code
}
catch (int i) {
    // handle int exceptions
}
catch (const char* str) {
    // handle string exceptions  
}
catch (...) {  // catch-all handler
    // handle any other exception type
    cout << "Unknown exception caught!" << endl;
}
```

**Custom termination handlers** can be set up, but this requires advanced knowledge of the Standard Library and is compiler-specific.

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Always match exception types** exactly with catch handlers
2. **Use try blocks** around code that might throw exceptions
3. **Provide appropriate catch handlers** for expected exception types
4. **Consider using catch-all handlers** `catch(...)` for unexpected exceptions
5. **Remember that exception handling transfers control**, not calls functions
6. **Use class types for exceptions** when you need more sophisticated error information
7. **Keep exception handling localized** to appropriate scopes
8. **Test exception paths** thoroughly in your programs
