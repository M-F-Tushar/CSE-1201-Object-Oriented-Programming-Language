## Introduction

**Inline functions** in C++ are functions that are expanded in-line at the point of each call, rather than being actually called. This mechanism works similarly to C-like parameterized macros, but with additional benefits and structure.

When you declare a function as `inline`, the compiler attempts to replace each function call with the actual function code, eliminating the overhead of function call and return mechanisms.

---

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
- **No function call overhead**: Eliminates the time cost of function call and return instructions
- **Faster execution**: Machine instructions for calling functions take time, especially with parameters
- **Better optimization**: Compilers can often optimize inline functions more thoroughly than macro expansions
- **Type safety**: Unlike macros, inline functions maintain C++ type checking
- **Structured approach**: More organized than parameterized macros

### Disadvantages
- **Code bloat**: If inline functions are too large and called frequently, the program size increases significantly
- **Compilation dependency**: Function must be defined before first use

---

## Basic Syntax

To declare an inline function, use the `inline` keyword before the function definition:

```cpp
inline return_type function_name(parameters) {
    // function body
}
```

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Request vs Command
The `inline` specifier is a **request** to the compiler, not a command. If the compiler cannot fulfill the request for various reasons, it will compile the function as a normal function.

### 2. Definition Before Use
An inline function **must be defined before it is first called**. If it isn't, the compiler has no way to know that it should be expanded in-line.

### 3. Compiler Restrictions
Many compilers have restrictions on what functions can be inlined:
- Functions with static variables
- Functions containing loops
- Functions with switch statements
- Functions with goto statements
- Recursive functions

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Inline Function

```cpp
// Example of an in-line function
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

inline int even(int x) {
    return !(x % 2);
}

int main() {
    if(even(10))
        cout << "10 is even\n";
    if(even(11))
        cout << "11 is even\n";
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The `even()` function checks if a number is even by using the modulo operator
- When declared as `inline`, the function call `even(10)` is replaced with `!(10 % 2)`
- This eliminates the overhead of calling the function
- The function returns `true` (non-zero) if the number is even, `false` (zero) if odd

**Output:**
```
10 is even
```

### Example 2: Inline Member Function

```cpp
// Demonstrate in-lining a member function
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class samp {
    int i, j;
public:
    samp(int a, int b);
    int divisible(); // will be in-lined in its definition
};

samp::samp(int a, int b) {
    i = a;
    j = b;
}

/*
Return 1 if i is evenly divisible by j.
This member function is expanded in line.
*/
inline int samp::divisible() {
    return !(i % j);
}

int main() {
    samp ob1(10, 2), ob2(10, 3);
    
    // this is true
    if(ob1.divisible())
        cout << "10 divisible by 2\n";
    
    // this is false
    if(ob2.divisible())
        cout << "10 divisible by 3\n";
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- This example shows how member functions can be inlined
- The `divisible()` function checks if the first member variable `i` is evenly divisible by the second member variable `j`
- Object `ob1` has values (10, 2), so `10 % 2 = 0`, making `!(0) = true`
- Object `ob2` has values (10, 3), so `10 % 3 = 1`, making `!(1) = false`
- The inline function is expanded at the point of call, eliminating function call overhead

**Output:**
```
10 divisible by 2
```

### Example 3: Overloaded Inline Functions

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Overload min() three ways - all inline

// integers
inline int min(int a, int b) {
    return a < b ? a : b;
}

// longs
inline long min(long a, long b) {
    return a < b ? a : b;
}

// doubles
inline double min(double a, double b) {
    return a < b ? a : b;
}

int main() {
    cout << min(-10, 10) << "\n";        // calls int version
    cout << min(-10.0, 100.002) << "\n"; // calls double version
    cout << min(-10L, 12L) << "\n";      // calls long version
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- This example demonstrates that overloaded functions can be inlined
- Three versions of `min()` are defined for different data types: `int`, `long`, and `double`
- Each uses the ternary operator `?:` to return the smaller value
- The compiler selects the appropriate version based on the argument types:
  - `min(-10, 10)`: Both are int literals, calls int version
  - `min(-10.0, 100.002)`: Both are double literals, calls double version
  - `min(-10L, 12L)`: Both are long literals (L suffix), calls long version

**Output:**
```
-10
-10
-10
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Inline Absolute Value Functions

**Problem:** In Chapter 1 you overloaded the `abs()` function so that it could find the absolute value of integers, long integers, and doubles. Modify that program so that those functions are expanded in line.

**Solution:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Overloaded abs() functions - all inline

// integers
inline int abs(int a) {
    return a < 0 ? -a : a;
}

// long integers
inline long abs(long a) {
    return a < 0 ? -a : a;
}

// doubles
inline double abs(double a) {
    return a < 0 ? -a : a;
}

int main() {
    cout << "abs(-10) = " << abs(-10) << "\n";
    cout << "abs(-10L) = " << abs(-10L) << "\n";
    cout << "abs(-10.5) = " << abs(-10.5) << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- Each `abs()` function is declared with the `inline` keyword
- The functions use the ternary operator to return the absolute value
- If the input is negative, it returns the negation (making it positive)
- If the input is already positive or zero, it returns the value unchanged
- The compiler will expand these functions in-line, eliminating function call overhead

### Exercise 2: Function Inlining Analysis

**Problem:** Why might the following function not be in-lined by your compiler?

```cpp
void f1() {
    int i;
    for(i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        cout << i;
}
```

**Answer and Explanation:**

The function `f1()` might not be inlined by the compiler for the following reasons:

1. **Contains a loop statement**: The function contains a `for` loop, which is one of the common restrictions for inline functions. Many compilers will not inline functions that contain loops because:
   - The resulting inline code would be much larger
   - Loop unrolling might make the code size excessive
   - The complexity of optimization increases significantly

2. **Code size concerns**: Even if the compiler could inline it, the loop would be expanded at every call site, potentially causing significant code bloat.

3. **Compiler-specific restrictions**: Different compilers have different policies about what they will and won't inline.

**Better alternatives:**
- Keep the function as a regular function call
- If performance is critical, consider loop unrolling manually for small, fixed iteration counts
- Use compiler optimization flags that might allow more aggressive inlining

## Best Practices and Restrictions

### When to Use Inline Functions
- **Short functions**: Only small functions should be inlined
- **Frequently called functions**: Functions called many times benefit most from inlining
- **Simple operations**: Functions with simple logic are good candidates

### When NOT to Use Inline Functions
- **Large functions**: Will cause code bloat
- **Complex functions**: May not be inlined by compiler anyway
- **Functions with loops, switches, or goto statements**: Often restricted by compilers
- **Recursive functions**: Generally cannot be inlined

### Important Notes
- Always check your compiler's documentation for specific inline restrictions
- If any inline restriction is violated, the compiler will generate a normal function
- Inline functions must be defined before they are first called
- The `inline` keyword is a request, not a guarantee

### Comparison with Macros
Inline functions are preferred over parameterized macros because:
- They provide better type checking
- They follow C++ scoping rules
- They're easier to debug
- They avoid macro expansion pitfalls (like missing parentheses)
- They can be optimized more effectively by the compiler
