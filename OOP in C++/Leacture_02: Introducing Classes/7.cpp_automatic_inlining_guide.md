## Introduction

**Automatic in-lining** is a feature in C++ where member functions become inline automatically when their definitions are included inside the class declaration. This eliminates the need for the explicit `inline` keyword while providing the same performance benefits.

When a function is defined within a class declaration, the compiler automatically attempts to make it an inline function, providing the same advantages as explicitly declared inline functions.

---

## Basic Concept

### How It Works
- If a member function's definition is **short enough** and included **inside the class declaration**, it automatically becomes an inline function
- The `inline` keyword is **no longer necessary** (though it's not an error to use it)
- **No separate definition** is needed or permitted outside the class

### Automatic Conversion
When a function defined inside a class declaration cannot be made into an inline function (due to compiler restrictions), it is automatically converted to a regular function.

---

## Syntax and Formatting

### Compact Style (Common in C++)
```cpp
class ClassName {
    // data members
public:
    return_type function_name(parameters) { return expression; }
};
```

### Standard Indentation Style
```cpp
class ClassName {
    // data members
public:
    return_type function_name(parameters) {
        return expression;
    }
};
```

**Note:** Both styles are functionally identical from the compiler's perspective. The compact style is commonly used for short functions in C++ programs.

---

## Key Rules and Restrictions

### Important Rules
1. **Definition inside class**: Function must be defined within the class declaration
2. **No external definition**: No separate definition outside the class is needed or allowed
3. **Automatic conversion**: Functions that can't be inlined become regular functions automatically
4. **Same restrictions apply**: All standard inline function restrictions still apply

### Restrictions (Same as Regular Inline Functions)
- Functions with static variables
- Functions containing loops
- Functions with switch statements
- Functions with goto statements
- Recursive functions
- Functions that are too large

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Automatic In-Lining

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class samp {
    int i, j;
public:
    samp(int a, int b);
    /* divisible() is defined here and automatically in-lined */
    int divisible() { return !(i%j); }
};

samp::samp(int a, int b) {
    i = a;
    j = b;
}

int main() {
    samp ob1(10, 2), ob2(10, 3);
    
    // this is true
    if(ob1.divisible())
        cout << "10 divisible by 2\n";
    
    // this is false
    if(ob2.divisible())
        cout << "10 divisible by 3\n";
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The `divisible()` function is defined inside the `samp` class declaration
- It automatically becomes an inline function without the `inline` keyword
- The function checks if `i` is evenly divisible by `j` using the modulo operator
- No separate definition of `divisible()` is needed outside the class
- The compact style `{ return !(i%j); }` is used for brevity

**Output:**
```
10 divisible by 2
```

### Example 2: Alternative Formatting Style

```cpp
class samp {
    int i, j;
public:
    samp(int a, int b);
    /* divisible() is defined here and automatically in-lined */
    int divisible() {
        return !(i%j);
    }
};
```

**Explanation:**
- This shows the same `divisible()` function using standard indentation
- Functionally identical to the compact style
- The compiler treats both formats exactly the same way
- Choice of style is purely a matter of preference and coding standards

### Example 3: Inline Constructor

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class samp {
    int i, j;
public:
    // inline constructor
    samp(int a, int b) { i = a; j = b; }
    int divisible() { return !(i%j); }
};

int main() {
    samp ob1(10, 2), ob2(10, 3);
    
    if(ob1.divisible())
        cout << "10 divisible by 2\n";
    
    if(ob2.divisible())
        cout << "10 divisible by 3\n";
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The constructor `samp(int a, int b)` is defined inside the class declaration
- It automatically becomes an inline function
- This is very common for simple constructors that just initialize member variables
- No separate definition outside the class is needed
- Both the constructor and `divisible()` function are automatically inlined

**Output:**
```
10 divisible by 2
```

### Example 4: Functions with Limited Inline Benefit

```cpp
class myclass {
    int i;
public:
    myclass(int n) { i = n; }
    void show() { cout << i; }
};
```

**Explanation:**
- The `show()` function is automatically inlined even though the benefit is minimal
- I/O operations (like `cout`) are typically much slower than CPU/memory operations
- The overhead of function calls becomes negligible compared to I/O time
- However, it's still common to define such functions inline for convenience
- No harm is caused by making simple I/O functions inline

**Key Point:** Even when inline benefits are minimal, automatic inlining is often used for convenience and code organization.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Convert Stack Class to Use Automatic In-Lining

**Problem:** Convert the stack class from Section 2.1, Example 1, so that it uses automatic in-line functions where appropriate.

**Original Stack Class (Assumed Structure):**
```cpp
class stack {
    int stck[SIZE];
    int tos;
public:
    stack();
    void push(int i);
    int pop();
};
```

**Solution with Automatic In-Lining:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#define SIZE 10

class stack {
    int stck[SIZE];
    int tos;
public:
    // Inline constructor
    stack() { tos = 0; }
    
    // Inline push function
    void push(int i) {
        if(tos == SIZE) {
            cout << "Stack is full.\n";
            return;
        }
        stck[tos] = i;
        tos++;
    }
    
    // Inline pop function
    int pop() {
        if(tos == 0) {
            cout << "Stack underflow.\n";
            return 0;
        }
        tos--;
        return stck[tos];
    }
};

int main() {
    stack s1, s2;
    
    s1.push(1);
    s1.push(2);
    s1.push(3);
    
    s2.push(10);
    s2.push(20);
    
    cout << "Stack s1: ";
    for(int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
        cout << s1.pop() << " ";
    cout << "\n";
    
    cout << "Stack s2: ";
    for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
        cout << s2.pop() << " ";
    cout << "\n";
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Constructor `stack()`**: Simple initialization of `tos` to 0, perfect for inlining
- **`push()` function**: Short function with simple logic, good candidate for inlining
- **`pop()` function**: Short function with simple logic, good candidate for inlining
- All functions are defined within the class declaration, making them automatically inline
- The functions are short enough that inlining provides performance benefits without significant code bloat

**Output:**
```
Stack s1: 3 2 1 
Stack s2: 20 10 
```

### Exercise 2: Convert strtype Class to Use Automatic In-Lining

**Problem:** Convert the strtype class from Section 2.2, Example 3, so that it uses automatic in-line functions.

**Original strtype Class (Assumed Structure):**
```cpp
class strtype {
    char *p;
    int len;
public:
    strtype(char *s);
    ~strtype();
    void show();
};
```

**Solution with Automatic In-Lining:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
#include <cstdlib>
using namespace std;

class strtype {
    char *p;
    int len;
public:
    // Inline constructor
    strtype(char *s) {
        len = strlen(s);
        p = (char *) malloc(len + 1);
        if(!p) {
            cout << "Allocation error\n";
            exit(1);
        }
        strcpy(p, s);
    }
    
    // Inline destructor
    ~strtype() {
        cout << "Freeing " << p << "\n";
        free(p);
    }
    
    // Inline show function
    void show() {
        cout << p << " - length: " << len << "\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    strtype s1("This is a test");
    strtype s2("Hello World");
    
    s1.show();
    s2.show();
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Constructor `strtype(char *s)`**: Handles memory allocation and string copying
  - Even though it's longer, it's still a good candidate for inlining as it's called once per object
  - Contains initialization logic that benefits from inlining
- **Destructor `~strtype()`**: Simple cleanup function, excellent for inlining
  - Destructors are commonly inlined as they're typically short
- **`show()` function**: Simple output function, good for inlining despite I/O operations
  - While I/O is slow, the function is still short and simple

**Output:**
```
This is a test - length: 14
Hello World - length: 11
Freeing Hello World
Freeing This is a test
```

**Note:** The destructor output shows the objects being freed in reverse order of creation (LIFO - Last In, First Out), which is normal behavior for automatic objects.

## Best Practices

### When to Use Automatic In-Lining

#### Excellent Candidates
- **Constructors and destructors**: Usually short and called frequently
- **Simple accessor functions**: Functions that return member variables
- **Simple setter functions**: Functions that set member variables
- **Short computational functions**: Like the `divisible()` example

#### Good Candidates
- **Functions with simple logic**: Even if they contain I/O operations
- **Frequently called short functions**: Where call overhead matters
- **Functions that are part of tight loops**: When called many times

### When to Avoid Automatic In-Lining

#### Poor Candidates
- **Functions with loops**: May cause code bloat
- **Functions with complex logic**: Better as regular functions
- **Large functions**: Will increase executable size significantly
- **Functions with static variables**: May not be inlined anyway

### Code Organization Tips

1. **Keep it simple**: Only inline truly simple functions
2. **Consider readability**: Don't sacrifice code clarity for minor performance gains
3. **Use compact style**: For very short functions, use single-line format
4. **Use standard style**: For longer inline functions, use normal indentation
5. **Document when necessary**: Comment why a function is inlined if it's not obvious

### Performance Considerations

- **Measure performance**: Don't assume inlining always improves performance
- **Consider code size**: Inlining can increase executable size
- **Profile your code**: Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks
- **Trust the compiler**: Modern compilers are good at optimization decisions

Remember: Automatic in-lining is a powerful feature, but like all optimizations, it should be used judiciously and measured for actual performance impact.
