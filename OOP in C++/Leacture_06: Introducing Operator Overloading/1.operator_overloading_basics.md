# 6.1 THE BASICS OF OPERATOR OVERLOADING

## Overview

Operator overloading is a special form of function overloading that allows you to define how operators work with user-defined types (classes). When you overload an operator, it retains its original meaning while gaining additional functionality for your specific class.

## Key Concepts

### What is Operator Overloading?
- **Definition**: Operator overloading allows you to define custom behavior for operators when used with user-defined types
- **Relationship to Function Overloading**: Operator overloading is essentially a specialized type of function overloading
- **Preservation of Original Meaning**: Overloaded operators don't lose their original functionality; they gain additional meaning for specific classes

### Operator Function Structure

The general syntax for a member operator function is:

```cpp
return_type class_name::operator#(arg_list) {
    // operation to be performed
}
```

**Components Explained:**
- `return_type`: Often the class type itself, but can be any valid type
- `class_name`: The class for which the operator is being overloaded
- `operator#`: The keyword `operator` followed by the operator symbol (e.g., `operator+`)
- `arg_list`: Parameters that vary based on the operator type and implementation

### Example: Basic Operator Overloading

```cpp
class Counter {
private:
    int count;
public:
    Counter(int c = 0) : count(c) {}
    
    // Overload the + operator
    Counter operator+(const Counter& other) {
        return Counter(count + other.count);
    }
    
    // Overload the ++ operator (prefix)
    Counter operator++() {
        ++count;
        return *this;
    }
    
    int getValue() const { return count; }
};

// Usage example
Counter c1(5);
Counter c2(3);
Counter c3 = c1 + c2;  // Uses overloaded + operator
++c1;                  // Uses overloaded ++ operator
```

## Important Restrictions

### 1. Precedence Cannot Be Changed
- The precedence of operators remains fixed
- You cannot make `+` have higher precedence than `*`

**Example:**
```cpp
// This expression will still follow normal precedence rules
// even with overloaded operators
result = a + b * c;  // * is evaluated before +
```

### 2. Number of Operands Cannot Be Altered
- Unary operators must remain unary
- Binary operators must remain binary

**Example:**
```cpp
// WRONG: Cannot make division operator unary
// Counter operator/(/* no parameters */) { ... }  // Error!

// CORRECT: Division remains binary
Counter operator/(const Counter& other) { ... }
```

## Operators That Cannot Be Overloaded

The following operators cannot be overloaded:
- `.` (dot operator)
- `::` (scope resolution operator)
- `.*` (pointer-to-member operator)
- `?` (ternary operator)
- Preprocessor operators

**Example of What You CAN Overload:**
```cpp
class Matrix {
public:
    // These CAN be overloaded
    Matrix operator+(const Matrix& other);    // Addition
    Matrix operator-(const Matrix& other);    // Subtraction
    Matrix operator*(const Matrix& other);    // Multiplication
    bool operator==(const Matrix& other);     // Equality
    Matrix& operator=(const Matrix& other);   // Assignment
    double& operator[](int index);            // Subscript
    Matrix& operator++();                     // Increment
    // ... and many more
};
```

## Member vs Friend Operator Functions

### Member Operator Functions
- Defined inside the class
- Have implicit access to the object's private members
- The left operand is the calling object

```cpp
class Point {
private:
    int x, y;
public:
    Point(int x = 0, int y = 0) : x(x), y(y) {}
    
    // Member function - left operand is 'this'
    Point operator+(const Point& other) {
        return Point(x + other.x, y + other.y);
    }
};

// Usage: p1 + p2 (p1 is the calling object)
```

### Friend Operator Functions
- Defined outside the class but declared as friend
- Can access private members of both operands
- More flexible for certain operations

```cpp
class Point {
private:
    int x, y;
public:
    Point(int x = 0, int y = 0) : x(x), y(y) {}
    
    // Friend function declaration
    friend Point operator+(const Point& p1, const Point& p2);
};

// Friend function definition
Point operator+(const Point& p1, const Point& p2) {
    return Point(p1.x + p2.x, p1.y + p2.y);
}
```

## Inheritance and Operator Overloading

### Key Points:
- **Inheritance**: All operator functions (except `=`) are inherited by derived classes
- **Override Freedom**: Derived classes can overload any operator, including those already overloaded by the base class

**Example:**
```cpp
class Base {
public:
    Base operator+(const Base& other) {
        // Base implementation
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    // Inherited: operator+ from Base
    
    // Can override with own implementation
    Derived operator+(const Derived& other) {
        // Derived-specific implementation
    }
};
```

## Real-World Examples

### 1. Stream Operators (<< and >>)
You've already been using overloaded operators:

```cpp
// These are overloaded operators for I/O
std::cout << "Hello World" << std::endl;
std::cin >> userInput;

// They don't lose their original meaning as bit shift operators
int shifted = 5 << 2;  // Still works: 5 left-shifted by 2 positions
```

### 2. String Class Example
```cpp
class MyString {
private:
    char* str;
    int length;
public:
    MyString(const char* s = "");
    
    // Overload + for string concatenation
    MyString operator+(const MyString& other) {
        // Implementation for string concatenation
    }
    
    // Overload == for string comparison
    bool operator==(const MyString& other) {
        // Implementation for string comparison
    }
    
    // Overload [] for character access
    char& operator[](int index) {
        // Implementation for character access
    }
};

// Usage
MyString s1("Hello");
MyString s2("World");
MyString s3 = s1 + s2;  // Concatenation
if (s1 == s2) { ... }   // Comparison
char c = s1[0];         // Character access
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Stay Within the Spirit of the Operator
- **Good**: Using `+` for addition, concatenation, or combining objects
- **Bad**: Using `/` to write text to a file 300 times

### 2. Provide Visual Clues
- Even when using operators in non-traditional ways (like `<<` and `>>` for I/O), choose operators that provide visual hints about their function
- The arrows in `<<` and `>>` suggest direction of data flow

### 3. Be Consistent
- If you overload `+`, consider overloading `+=`
- If you overload `==`, consider overloading `!=`

**Example of Consistent Overloading:**
```cpp
class Vector {
public:
    Vector operator+(const Vector& other);
    Vector& operator+=(const Vector& other);
    bool operator==(const Vector& other);
    bool operator!=(const Vector& other);
};
```

## Exercise: Complex Number Class

Create a complex number class with overloaded operators:

```cpp
class Complex {
private:
    double real, imag;
public:
    Complex(double r = 0, double i = 0) : real(r), imag(i) {}
    
    // TODO: Implement these operators
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other);
    Complex operator-(const Complex& other);
    Complex operator*(const Complex& other);
    bool operator==(const Complex& other);
    
    void display() const {
        std::cout << real << " + " << imag << "i" << std::endl;
    }
};

// Test your implementation
int main() {
    Complex c1(3, 4);
    Complex c2(1, 2);
    
    Complex sum = c1 + c2;      // Should be (4, 6)
    Complex diff = c1 - c2;     // Should be (2, 2)
    Complex product = c1 * c2;  // Should be (-5, 10)
    
    if (c1 == c2) {
        std::cout << "Equal" << std::endl;
    } else {
        std::cout << "Not equal" << std::endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Important Restrictions Summary

1. **No Default Arguments**: Operator functions cannot have default parameters
2. **Fixed Precedence**: Cannot change operator precedence
3. **Fixed Operand Count**: Cannot change the number of operands an operator takes
4. **Specific Operators Only**: Cannot overload `.`, `::`, `.*`, `?`, and preprocessor operators
5. **User-Defined Types**: Operators can only be overloaded for user-defined types (classes)

## Key Takeaways

- Operator overloading makes user-defined types more intuitive to use
- Always preserve the natural meaning and intuition of operators
- Member and friend operator functions each have their place
- Consistency in operator overloading improves code readability
- The assignment operator (`=`) is special and not inherited by derived classes
