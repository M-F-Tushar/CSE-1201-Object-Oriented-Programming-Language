# 5.6 FINDING THE ADDRESS OF AN OVERLOADED FUNCTION

## Introduction

This chapter concludes by exploring how to find the address of an overloaded function in C++. Just as in C, you can assign the address of a function (its entry point) to a pointer and access that function via that pointer.

## Basic Function Address Assignment

A function's address is obtained by putting its name on the right side of an assignment statement **without any parentheses or arguments**.

### Basic Syntax
```cpp
// If zap() is a function, this assigns p the address of zap()
p = zap;  // Note: no parentheses or arguments
```

## The Challenge with Overloaded Functions

### C vs C++ Complexity
- **In C:** Any type of pointer can be used to point to a function because there is only one function that it can point to
- **In C++:** The situation is more complex because a function can be overloaded, creating multiple functions with the same name

### The Solution
The mechanism that determines which overloaded function's address is obtained is both **elegant and effective**:

> **Key Principle:** When obtaining the address of an overloaded function, it is the way the pointer is declared that determines which overloaded function's address will be obtained.

**How it works:**
1. The pointer's declaration is matched against those of the overloaded functions
2. The function whose declaration matches is the one whose address is used
3. The declaration of the function pointer must **exactly match** one and only one of the overloaded functions

## Example 1: Space Function Overloading

### Complete Program Demonstration

```cpp
/* Illustrate assigning function pointers to overloaded functions. */
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Output count number of spaces.
void space(int count) {
    for (; count; count--)
        cout << ' ';
}

// Output count number of chs.
void space(int count, char ch) {
    for (; count; count--)
        cout << ch;
}

int main() {
    /* Create a pointer to void function with one int parameter */
    void (*fp1)(int);
    
    /* Create a pointer to void function with one int parameter 
       and one character parameter. */
    void (*fp2)(int, char);
    
    fp1 = space;  // gets address of space(int)
    fp2 = space;  // gets address of space(int, char)
    
    fp1(22);      // output 22 spaces
    cout << "|\n";
    
    fp2(30, 'x'); // output 30 x's
    cout << "|\n";
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Program Output
```
                      |
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx|
```

### Explanation of Example 1

1. **Two Overloaded Functions:**
   - `space(int count)` - outputs spaces
   - `space(int count, char ch)` - outputs specified characters

2. **Function Pointer Declarations:**
   - `void (*fp1)(int)` - pointer to function taking one int parameter
   - `void (*fp2)(int, char)` - pointer to function taking int and char parameters

3. **Address Assignment:**
   - `fp1 = space` - compiler matches this to `space(int)` based on fp1's declaration
   - `fp2 = space` - compiler matches this to `space(int, char)` based on fp2's declaration

4. **Function Calls:**
   - `fp1(22)` - calls `space(int)` with argument 22
   - `fp2(30, 'x')` - calls `space(int, char)` with arguments 30 and 'x'

## Key Rules and Requirements

### Matching Requirements
- The function pointer declaration must **exactly match** one and only one of the overloaded functions
- If the declaration doesn't match exactly, **ambiguity will be introduced**, causing a compile-time error

### Review Points
1. When you assign the address of an overloaded function to a function pointer, it is the **declaration of the pointer** that determines which function's address is assigned
2. The pointer declaration acts as a "template" that the compiler uses to select the correct overloaded function
3. There must be an exact match - no ambiguity is allowed

## Exercise 1: Practice with Overloaded Functions

### Given Functions
```cpp
int dif(int a, int b) {
    return a - b;
}

float dif(float a, float b) {
    return a - b;
}
```

### Question
Show how to obtain the address of each overloaded function.

### Solution
```cpp
// To get the address of int dif(int a, int b)
int (*ptr1)(int, int);
ptr1 = dif;  // Gets address of int version

// To get the address of float dif(float a, float b)
float (*ptr2)(float, float);
ptr2 = dif;  // Gets address of float version
```

### Complete Working Example
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int dif(int a, int b) {
    return a - b;
}

float dif(float a, float b) {
    return a - b;
}

int main() {
    // Declare function pointers
    int (*ptr1)(int, int);
    float (*ptr2)(float, float);
    
    // Assign addresses
    ptr1 = dif;  // Gets address of int version
    ptr2 = dif;  // Gets address of float version
    
    // Use the function pointers
    cout << "Integer difference: " << ptr1(10, 3) << endl;
    cout << "Float difference: " << ptr2(10.5f, 3.2f) << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Exercise Output
```
Integer difference: 7
Float difference: 7.3
```

## Common Pitfalls and Error Prevention

### Ambiguity Errors
If your function pointer declaration doesn't exactly match one of the overloaded functions, you'll get a compile-time error:

```cpp
// This would cause an error if we had:
// void func(int);
// void func(float);
// And we declared:
void (*ambiguous_ptr)(double);  // No exact match!
```

### Best Practices
1. Always ensure exact parameter type matching
2. Include const qualifiers if the target function has them
3. Match return types exactly
4. Be careful with implicit conversions - they don't apply to function pointer matching

## Summary

The ability to obtain addresses of overloaded functions in C++ demonstrates the language's sophisticated type system. The compiler uses the function pointer's declaration as a template to select the correct overloaded function, ensuring type safety while maintaining the flexibility of function overloading. This mechanism is both elegant in its simplicity and effective in resolving potential ambiguities.
