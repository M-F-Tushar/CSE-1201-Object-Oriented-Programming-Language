## Introduction

**Object assignment** in C++ allows one object to be assigned to another, provided both objects are of the same type. This is a fundamental feature that enables copying data from one object to another using the assignment operator (=).

When objects are assigned, C++ performs a **bitwise copy** of all data members by default, creating an exact duplicate of the source object's data in the destination object.

---

## Basic Concept

### Requirements for Object Assignment
- Both objects must be of the **same type**
- Type names must be **identical** (not just physically similar)
- Objects remain **completely separate** after assignment

### Default Behavior
- **Bitwise copy**: All data members are copied bit by bit
- **Shallow copy**: Pointers are copied, not the data they point to
- **Member-by-member assignment**: Each data member is individually copied

---

## Default Assignment Behavior

### How It Works
```cpp
object1 = object2;  // Copies all data members from object2 to object1
```

### What Happens
1. Each data member of `object2` is copied to the corresponding member of `object1`
2. Arrays and other compound data structures are copied entirely
3. Pointers are copied (address values), not the data they point to
4. Both objects remain independent after assignment

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Object Assignment

```cpp
// An example of object assignment
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class myclass {
    int a, b;
public:
    void set(int i, int j) { a = i; b = j; }
    void show() { cout << a << ' ' << b << "\n"; }
};

int main() {
    myclass o1, o2;
    
    o1.set(10, 4);
    
    // assign o1 to o2
    o2 = o1;
    
    o1.show();
    o2.show();
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `o1` is initialized with values `a = 10` and `b = 4`
- The assignment `o2 = o1` copies all data members from `o1` to `o2`
- After assignment, `o2.a = 10` and `o2.b = 4`
- Both objects contain identical data but remain separate entities
- Modifying `o1` after assignment won't affect `o2`

**Output:**
```
10 4
10 4
```

### Example 2: Type Compatibility Error

```cpp
// This program has an error
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class myclass {
    int a, b;
public:
    void set(int i, int j) { a = i; b = j; }
    void show() { cout << a << ' ' << b << "\n"; }
};

/*
This class is similar to myclass but uses a
different class name and thus appears as a different
type to the compiler.
*/
class yourclass {
    int a, b;
public:
    void set(int i, int j) { a = i; b = j; }
    void show() { cout << a << ' ' << b << "\n"; }
};

int main() {
    myclass o1;
    yourclass o2;
    
    o1.set(10, 4);
    
    o2 = o1; // ERROR: objects not of same type
    
    o1.show();
    o2.show();
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `myclass` and `yourclass` are **physically identical** (same data members and methods)
- However, they have **different type names**, making them different types to the compiler
- The assignment `o2 = o1` will cause a **compile-time error**
- C++ requires **exact type matching** for object assignment
- Physical similarity is not sufficient; type names must be identical

**Error Message:**
```
error: no viable overloaded '='
```

### Example 3: Array Assignment in Objects

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#define SIZE 10

// Declare a stack class for characters
class stack {
    char stck[SIZE]; // holds the stack
    int tos;         // index of top of stack
public:
    stack();         // constructor
    void push(char ch); // push character on stack
    char pop();      // pop character from stack
};

// Initialize the stack
stack::stack() {
    cout << "Constructing a stack\n";
    tos = 0;
}

// Push a character
void stack::push(char ch) {
    if(tos == SIZE) {
        cout << "Stack is full\n";
        return;
    }
    stck[tos] = ch;
    tos++;
}

// Pop a character
char stack::pop() {
    if(tos == 0) {
        cout << "Stack is empty\n";
        return 0; // return null on empty stack
    }
    tos--;
    return stck[tos];
}

int main() {
    // Create two stacks that are automatically initialized
    stack s1, s2;
    int i;
    
    s1.push('a');
    s1.push('b');
    s1.push('c');
    
    // clone s1
    s2 = s1; // now s1 and s2 are identical
    
    for(i = 0; i < 3; i++)
        cout << "Pop s1: " << s1.pop() << "\n";
    
    for(i = 0; i < 3; i++)
        cout << "Pop s2: " << s2.pop() << "\n";
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- Only `s1` has characters pushed onto it (`'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'`)
- The assignment `s2 = s1` copies **all data members** including:
  - The entire `stck` array (all 10 characters)
  - The `tos` value (index of top of stack)
- After assignment, `s2` contains an exact copy of `s1`'s data
- Both stacks are independent; popping from one doesn't affect the other
- This demonstrates that **compound data structures** (arrays) are fully copied

**Output:**
```
Constructing a stack
Constructing a stack
Pop s1: c
Pop s1: b
Pop s1: a
Pop s2: c
Pop s2: b
Pop s2: a
```

## Common Pitfalls

### Example 4: Dangerous Pointer Assignment

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
#include <cstdlib>
using namespace std;

class strtype {
    char *p;
    int len;
public:
    strtype(char *ptr);
    ~strtype();
    void show();
};

strtype::strtype(char *ptr) {
    len = strlen(ptr);
    p = (char*) malloc(len + 1);
    if(!p) {
        cout << "Allocation error\n";
        exit(1);
    }
    strcpy(p, ptr);
}

strtype::~strtype() {
    cout << "Freeing p\n";
    free(p);
}

void strtype::show() {
    cout << p << " - length: " << len;
    cout << "\n";
}

int main() {
    strtype s1("This is a test."), s2("I like C++.");
    
    s1.show();
    s2.show();
    
    // assign s1 to s2 -- this generates an error
    s2 = s1;
    
    s1.show();
    s2.show();
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation of the Problem:**
This program contains a **serious bug** related to pointer assignment:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `s1.p` points to allocated memory containing "This is a test."
   - `s2.p` points to allocated memory containing "I like C++."

2. **After Assignment (`s2 = s1`):**
   - `s2.p` now points to the **same memory** as `s1.p`
   - The original memory pointed to by `s2.p` is **lost** (memory leak)
   - Both objects now share the same memory

3. **Destruction Problem:**
   - When `s1` is destroyed, its memory is freed
   - When `s2` is destroyed, it tries to free the **same memory again**
   - This causes **double deletion** - undefined behavior
   - The original `s2` memory is **never freed** - memory leak

**The Issues:**
- **Double deletion**: Same memory freed twice
- **Memory leak**: Original `s2` memory never freed
- **Dangling pointer**: After `s1` is destroyed, `s2.p` points to freed memory

**Output (before crash):**
```
This is a test. - length: 15
I like C++. - length: 11
This is a test. - length: 15
This is a test. - length: 15
Freeing p
Freeing p    // This will cause undefined behavior
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Type Mismatch Error

**Problem:** What is wrong with the following program?

```cpp
// This program has an error
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class cl1 {
    int i, j;
public:
    cl1(int a, int b) { i = a; j = b; }
    // ...
};

class cl2 {
    int i, j;
public:
    cl2(int a, int b) { i = a; j = b; }
    // ...
};

int main() {
    cl1 x(10, 20);
    cl2 y(0, 0);
    
    x = y;  // ERROR!
    
    // ...
}
```

**Answer and Explanation:**

The error is in the line `x = y;`. This assignment is invalid because:

1. **Different Types**: `x` is of type `cl1` and `y` is of type `cl2`
2. **Type Name Requirement**: C++ requires objects to have **identical type names** for assignment
3. **Physical Similarity Irrelevant**: Even though `cl1` and `cl2` have identical structure (same data members `i` and `j`), they are considered different types
4. **Compile-Time Error**: The compiler will report a type mismatch error

**Correct Approaches:**
```cpp
// Option 1: Use same type
cl1 x(10, 20);
cl1 y(0, 0);    // Same type as x
x = y;          // Now this works

// Option 2: Member-by-member assignment (if members are public)
// This would require public access to i and j
// x.i = y.i; x.j = y.j;

// Option 3: Conversion constructor or assignment operator
// Would require custom implementation
```

### Exercise 2: Queue Assignment

**Problem:** Using the queue class that you created for Chapter 2, Section 2.1, Exercise 1, show how one queue can be assigned to another.

**Solution:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#define SIZE 10

class queue {
    int q[SIZE];
    int head, tail;
public:
    queue();           // constructor
    void put(int i);   // put element in queue
    int get();         // get element from queue
    void show();       // show queue contents
};

// Initialize queue
queue::queue() {
    head = tail = 0;
}

// Put an element in the queue
void queue::put(int i) {
    if(tail == SIZE) {
        cout << "Queue is full\n";
        return;
    }
    q[tail] = i;
    tail++;
}

// Get an element from the queue
int queue::get() {
    if(head == tail) {
        cout << "Queue is empty\n";
        return 0;
    }
    int temp = q[head];
    head++;
    return temp;
}

// Show queue contents
void queue::show() {
    cout << "Queue contents: ";
    for(int i = head; i < tail; i++) {
        cout << q[i] << " ";
    }
    cout << "\n";
}

int main() {
    queue q1, q2;
    
    // Add elements to q1
    q1.put(10);
    q1.put(20);
    q1.put(30);
    
    cout << "Original q1: ";
    q1.show();
    
    cout << "Original q2: ";
    q2.show();
    
    // Assign q1 to q2
    q2 = q1;
    
    cout << "After assignment:\n";
    cout << "q1: ";
    q1.show();
    cout << "q2: ";
    q2.show();
    
    // Demonstrate independence
    q1.put(40);
    cout << "After adding 40 to q1:\n";
    cout << "q1: ";
    q1.show();
    cout << "q2: ";
    q2.show();
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The assignment `q2 = q1` copies all data members:
  - The entire `q` array (all SIZE elements)
  - The `head` and `tail` indices
- After assignment, `q2` contains an exact copy of `q1`'s data
- Both queues are independent; modifying one doesn't affect the other
- This works because all data is stored directly in the object (no dynamic allocation)

**Output:**
```
Original q1: Queue contents: 10 20 30 
Original q2: Queue contents: 
After assignment:
q1: Queue contents: 10 20 30 
q2: Queue contents: 10 20 30 
After adding 40 to q1:
q1: Queue contents: 10 20 30 40 
q2: Queue contents: 10 20 30 
```

### Exercise 3: Dynamic Memory Assignment Problem

**Problem:** If the queue class from the preceding question dynamically allocates memory to hold the queue, why, in this situation, can one queue not be assigned to another?

**Answer and Explanation:**

If the queue class uses dynamic memory allocation, object assignment becomes problematic due to the **shallow copy** nature of default assignment. Here's why:

**Modified Queue Class with Dynamic Allocation:**
```cpp
class queue {
    int *q;          // Pointer to dynamically allocated array
    int head, tail;
    int size;
public:
    queue(int s);
    ~queue();
    // ... other methods
};

queue::queue(int s) {
    size = s;
    q = new int[size];   // Dynamic allocation
    head = tail = 0;
}

queue::~queue() {
    delete[] q;          // Free memory
}
```

**Problems with Assignment:**

1. **Shallow Copy Problem:**
   ```cpp
   queue q1(10), q2(5);
   q2 = q1;  // DANGEROUS!
   ```
   - After assignment, both `q1.q` and `q2.q` point to the **same memory**
   - The original memory allocated for `q2` is **lost** (memory leak)

2. **Double Deletion:**
   ```cpp
   // When objects go out of scope:
   // ~queue() called for q1: deletes the shared memory
   // ~queue() called for q2: tries to delete the same memory again!
   // Result: Undefined behavior, possible crash
   ```

3. **Memory Leak:**
   - The original memory allocated for `q2` is never freed
   - This causes a memory leak

**Visual Representation:**
```
Before assignment:
q1.q ──→ [Memory Block A]
q2.q ──→ [Memory Block B]

After assignment (q2 = q1):
q1.q ──→ [Memory Block A]
q2.q ──→ [Memory Block A]  // Both point to same memory!
         [Memory Block B]  // Lost! Memory leak!

During destruction:
~q1(): delete Memory Block A  ✓
~q2(): delete Memory Block A  ✗ (Already deleted - crash!)
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Deep Copy Assignment Operator:**
   ```cpp
   queue& operator=(const queue& other) {
       if(this != &other) {
           delete[] q;  // Free current memory
           size = other.size;
           q = new int[size];  // Allocate new memory
           // Copy data
           for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
               q[i] = other.q[i];
           }
           head = other.head;
           tail = other.tail;
       }
       return *this;
   }
   ```

2. **Copy Constructor:**
   ```cpp
   queue(const queue& other) {
       size = other.size;
       q = new int[size];
       for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
           q[i] = other.q[i];
       }
       head = other.head;
       tail = other.tail;
   }
   ```

3. **Prohibit Assignment:**
   ```cpp
   private:
       queue& operator=(const queue&);  // Declare but don't define
   ```

## Best Practices

### Safe Object Assignment

1. **Avoid Raw Pointers**: Use smart pointers or containers when possible
2. **Implement Rule of Three**: If you need custom destructor, you likely need custom copy constructor and assignment operator
3. **Test Assignment**: Always test object assignment in your programs
4. **Document Behavior**: Make it clear whether your class supports assignment

### When Default Assignment Works
- **Simple data types**: int, float, char, etc.
- **Arrays of simple types**: Entire arrays are copied
- **Objects without dynamic memory**: Stack-allocated data only
- **Objects with proper copy semantics**: Classes designed for copying

### When to Implement Custom Assignment
- **Dynamic memory allocation**: Need deep copy
- **Resource management**: Files, network connections, etc.
- **Reference counting**: Shared resources
- **Complex data structures**: Linked lists, trees, etc.

### Memory Management Guidelines
- **RAII Principle**: Resource Acquisition Is Initialization
- **Smart Pointers**: Use `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`
- **Standard Containers**: Use `std::vector`, `std::string`, etc.
- **Avoid Manual Memory Management**: Let C++ handle it automatically

Remember: Object assignment is a powerful feature, but with dynamic memory allocation, it requires careful implementation to avoid memory leaks and crashes.
