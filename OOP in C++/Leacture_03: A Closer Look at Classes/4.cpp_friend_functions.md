# 3.4 AN INTRODUCTION TO FRIEND FUNCTIONS

## Overview
A **friend function** is a non-member function that has access to the private members of a class. It provides a way to grant specific functions access to private data without making them class members.

## Key Concepts

### What is a Friend Function?
- **Not a member** of the class, but has access to its private elements
- **Declared inside** the class with the `friend` keyword
- **Defined outside** the class as a regular function
- **Cannot be called** using object.function() syntax

### Why Use Friend Functions?
1. **Operator overloading** (covered in later chapters)
2. **I/O functions** creation (covered in later chapters)
3. **Access to private members** of multiple different classes

---

## Basic Friend Function Example

Here's a fundamental example demonstrating friend function syntax and usage:

```cpp
// An example of a friend function.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class myclass {
    int n, d;
public:
    myclass(int i, int j) { n = i; d = j; }
    // declare a friend of myclass
    friend int isfactor(myclass ob);
};

/*
Here is friend function definition. It returns true
if d is a factor of n. Notice that the keyword friend is not
used in the definition of isfactor()
*/
int isfactor(myclass ob) {
    if (!(ob.n % ob.d))
        return 1;
    else
        return 0;
}

int main() {
    myclass ob1(10, 2), ob2(13, 3);
    
    if(isfactor(ob1))
        cout << "2 is a factor of 10\n";
    else
        cout << "2 is not a factor of 10\n";
        
    if(isfactor(ob2))
        cout << "3 is a factor of 13\n";
    else
        cout << "3 is not a factor of 13\n";
        
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
2 is a factor of 10
3 is not a factor of 13
```

### Key Points from This Example:
1. **Declaration**: `friend int isfactor(myclass ob);` inside the class
2. **Definition**: Normal function definition without `friend` keyword
3. **Access**: Can access `ob.n` and `ob.d` (private members)
4. **Calling**: Called as `isfactor(ob1)`, not `ob1.isfactor()`

---

## Important Friend Function Rules

### 1. **Not a Member Function**
```cpp
// WRONG - This will cause a compile error
ob1.isfactor(); // Error: isfactor() is not a member function
```

### 2. **Must Use Object to Access Private Members**
```cpp
int isfactor(myclass ob) {
    // CORRECT: Access through object
    if (!(ob.n % ob.d))
        return 1;
    
    // WRONG: Direct access (would cause error)
    // if (!(n % d))  // Error: n and d not directly accessible
}
```

### 3. **Not Inherited**
- When a base class has a friend function, that friend function is **not automatically a friend** of derived classes

### 4. **Can Be Friend to Multiple Classes**
- A single function can be declared as a friend in multiple class declarations

---

## Example 1: Friend Function with Multiple Classes

This example demonstrates a friend function that accesses private members of two different classes:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class truck; // a forward declaration

class car {
    int passengers;
    int speed;
public:
    car(int p, int s) { passengers = p; speed = s; }
    friend int sp_greater(car c, truck t);
};

class truck {
    int weight;
    int speed;
public:
    truck(int w, int s) { weight = w; speed = s; }
    friend int sp_greater(car c, truck t);
};

/*
Return positive if car speed faster than truck.
Return 0 if speeds are the same.
Return negative if truck speed faster than car.
*/
int sp_greater(car c, truck t) {
    return c.speed - t.speed;
}

int main() {
    int t;
    car c1(6, 55), c2(2, 120);
    truck t1(10000, 55), t2(20000, 72);
    
    cout << "Comparing c1 and t1:\n";
    t = sp_greater(c1, t1);
    if(t < 0)
        cout << "Truck is faster.\n";
    else if(t == 0)
        cout << "Car and truck speed is the same.\n";
    else
        cout << "Car is faster.\n";
        
    cout << "Comparing c2 and t2:\n";
    t = sp_greater(c2, t2);
    if(t < 0)
        cout << "Truck is faster.\n";
    else if(t == 0)
        cout << "Car and truck speed is the same.\n";
    else
        cout << "Car is faster.\n";
        
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Comparing c1 and t1:
Car and truck speed is the same.
Comparing c2 and t2:
Car is faster.
```

### Key Features:
1. **Forward Declaration**: `class truck;` allows `truck` to be used before full declaration
2. **Multiple Friend**: `sp_greater()` is friend to both `car` and `truck` classes
3. **Cross-Class Access**: Can access private members of both classes

### Forward Declaration Explained:
```cpp
class truck; // Forward declaration - tells compiler truck is a class name
```
**Why needed?** 
- `sp_greater()` needs both `car` and `truck` as parameters
- Impossible to declare both classes before using them
- Forward declaration resolves this circular dependency

---

## Example 2: Member Function as Friend

This example shows a function that is a member of one class and a friend of another:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class truck; // a forward declaration

class car {
    int passengers;
    int speed;
public:
    car(int p, int s) { passengers = p; speed = s; }
    int sp_greater(truck t);  // Member function declaration
};

class truck {
    int weight;
    int speed;
public:
    truck(int w, int s) { weight = w; speed = s; }
    // note new use of the scope resolution operator
    friend int car::sp_greater(truck t);
};

/*
Return positive if car speed faster than truck.
Return 0 if speeds are the same.
Return negative if truck speed faster than car.
*/
int car::sp_greater(truck t) {
    /*
    Since sp_greater() is member of car, only a
    truck object must be passed to it.
    */
    return speed - t.speed;  // 'speed' refers to this car's speed
}

int main() {
    int t;
    car c1(6, 55), c2(2, 120);
    truck t1(10000, 55), t2(20000, 72);
    
    cout << "Comparing c1 and t1:\n";
    t = c1.sp_greater(t1); // invoke as member function of car
    if(t < 0)
        cout << "Truck is faster.\n";
    else if(t == 0)
        cout << "Car and truck speed is the same.\n";
    else
        cout << "Car is faster.\n";
        
    cout << "Comparing c2 and t2:\n";
    t = c2.sp_greater(t2); // invoke as member function of car
    if(t < 0)
        cout << "Truck is faster.\n";
    else if(t == 0)
        cout << "Car and truck speed is the same.\n";
    else
        cout << "Car is faster.\n";
        
    return 0;
}
```

### Key Differences from Example 1:
1. **Member Function**: `sp_greater()` is now a member of `car` class
2. **Friend Declaration**: `friend int car::sp_greater(truck t);` in `truck` class
3. **Scope Resolution**: `car::sp_greater()` specifies which class the function belongs to
4. **Calling**: `c1.sp_greater(t1)` - called as member function
5. **Access**: Can access `speed` directly (car's member) and `t.speed` (truck's private via friend)

### Scope Resolution Operator Usage:
- **Full specification**: `car::sp_greater` tells compiler exactly which function
- **Redundant but valid**: `c1.car::sp_greater(t1)` works but unnecessary
- **Remember**: `class_name::member_name` fully specifies a class member

## Exercise: Shared Printer Status

**Problem:** Create a function that checks if a printer is in use by objects of two different classes.

**Task:** Create classes `pr1` and `pr2` that share a printer. Create a friend function `inuse()` that returns true when the printer is being used by either class.

**Given Classes:**
```cpp
class pr1 {
    int printing;
    // ...
public:
    pr1() { printing = 0; }
    void set_print(int status) { printing = status; }
    // ...
};

class pr2 {
    int printing;
    // ...
public:
    pr2() { printing = 0; }  // Added constructor
    void set_print(int status) { printing = status; }
    // ...
};
```

**Solution:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class pr2; // Forward declaration

class pr1 {
    int printing;
public:
    pr1() { printing = 0; }
    void set_print(int status) { printing = status; }
    friend bool inuse(pr1 p1, pr2 p2);
};

class pr2 {
    int printing;
public:
    pr2() { printing = 0; }
    void set_print(int status) { printing = status; }
    friend bool inuse(pr1 p1, pr2 p2);
};

// Friend function to check if printer is in use
bool inuse(pr1 p1, pr2 p2) {
    return (p1.printing || p2.printing);
}

int main() {
    pr1 printer1;
    pr2 printer2;
    
    cout << "Initially: " << (inuse(printer1, printer2) ? "Printer in use" : "Printer available") << "\n";
    
    printer1.set_print(1);  // pr1 starts printing
    cout << "After pr1 starts: " << (inuse(printer1, printer2) ? "Printer in use" : "Printer available") << "\n";
    
    printer1.set_print(0);  // pr1 stops printing
    printer2.set_print(1);  // pr2 starts printing
    cout << "After pr2 starts: " << (inuse(printer1, printer2) ? "Printer in use" : "Printer available") << "\n";
    
    printer2.set_print(0);  // pr2 stops printing
    cout << "After all stop: " << (inuse(printer1, printer2) ? "Printer in use" : "Printer available") << "\n";
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Initially: Printer available
After pr1 starts: Printer in use
After pr2 starts: Printer in use
After all stop: Printer available
```

**Explanation:**
- `inuse()` is friend to both `pr1` and `pr2`
- Can access private `printing` member of both classes
- Returns `true` if either printer object is printing
- Uses logical OR (`||`) to check both conditions

## Skills Check - Mastery Questions

### 1. **Object Assignment Prerequisite**
**Question:** What single prerequisite must be met in order for one object to be assigned to another?

**Answer:** Both objects must be of the **same class type**. The assignment operator performs memberwise copying of all data members from the source object to the destination object.

### 2. **Dynamic Memory Assignment Problem**
**Question:** Given this class fragment, what problem is caused by the assignment of ob1 to ob2?

```cpp
class samp {
    double *p;
public:
    samp(double d) {
        p = (double *) malloc(sizeof(double));
        if (!p)
            exit(1); // allocation error
        *p = d;
    }
    ~samp() { free(p); }
    // ..
};

// ...
samp ob1(123.09), ob2(0.0);
// ...
ob2 = ob1;
```

**Answer:** The assignment causes a **shallow copy problem**:
1. **Before assignment**: `ob1.p` and `ob2.p` point to different memory locations
2. **After assignment**: Both `ob1.p` and `ob2.p` point to the same memory location
3. **At destruction**: Both destructors will try to `free()` the same memory location
4. **Result**: Double-free error, memory corruption, and undefined behavior

**Visual representation:**
```
Before assignment:
ob1.p → [123.09]
ob2.p → [0.0]

After assignment:
ob1.p → [123.09]
ob2.p ↗

Memory leak: [0.0] is now unreachable
```

### 3. **Planet Light Travel Function**
**Question:** Create a function called `light()` that calculates travel time from sun to planet.

```cpp
class planet {
    int moons;
    double dist_from_sun; // in miles
    double diameter;
    double mass;
public:
    // ....
    double get_miles() { return dist_from_sun; }
};
```

**Solution:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class planet {
    int moons;
    double dist_from_sun; // in miles
    double diameter;
    double mass;
public:
    planet(int m, double dist, double diam, double ms) 
        : moons(m), dist_from_sun(dist), diameter(diam), mass(ms) {}
    double get_miles() { return dist_from_sun; }
    
    // Friend function declaration
    friend double light(planet p);
};

// Friend function to calculate light travel time
double light(planet p) {
    const double LIGHT_SPEED = 186000; // miles per second
    return p.dist_from_sun / LIGHT_SPEED;
}

int main() {
    planet earth(1, 93000000, 7918, 5.97e24);  // Earth: ~93 million miles from sun
    planet mars(2, 141600000, 4212, 6.39e23);  // Mars: ~141.6 million miles from sun
    
    cout << "Light travel time to Earth: " << light(earth) << " seconds\n";
    cout << "Light travel time to Mars: " << light(mars) << " seconds\n";
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Light travel time to Earth: 500 seconds
Light travel time to Mars: 760.86 seconds
```

### 4. **Object Address Passing**
**Question:** Can the address of an object be passed to a function as an argument?

**Answer:** **Yes**, absolutely. Object addresses can be passed to functions just like addresses of any other data type.

**Example:**
```cpp
void processObject(MyClass* obj) {
    // Access members using arrow operator
    obj->someMethod();
}

int main() {
    MyClass myObj;
    processObject(&myObj);  // Pass address of myObj
    return 0;
}
```

### 5. **Stack Loading Function**
**Question:** Write a function called `loadstack()` that returns a stack loaded with the alphabet.

**Solution:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class stack {
    char stck[52];  // Increased size to hold alphabet
    int tos;
public:
    stack() { tos = 0; }
    void push(char ch) {
        if (tos == 51) {
            cout << "Stack is full\n";
            return;
        }
        stck[tos] = ch;
        tos++;
    }
    char pop() {
        if (tos == 0) {
            cout << "Stack is empty\n";
            return 0;
        }
        tos--;
        return stck[tos];
    }
};

// Function that returns a stack loaded with alphabet
stack loadstack() {
    stack s;
    // Load alphabet a-z
    for (char c = 'a'; c <= 'z'; c++) {
        s.push(c);
    }
    return s;
}

int main() {
    stack myStack;
    myStack = loadstack();
    
    cout << "Stack contains (popping all elements): ";
    for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        cout << myStack.pop() << " ";
    }
    cout << "\n";
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Stack contains (popping all elements): z y x w v u t s r q p o n m l k j i h g f e d c b a
```

### 6. **Caution with Object Passing/Returning**
**Question:** Explain why you must be careful when passing objects to a function or returning objects from a function.

**Answer:** Several critical issues require caution:

**When Passing Objects:**
1. **Constructor not called** for copies made during parameter passing
2. **Destructor IS called** when parameter copy is destroyed
3. **Resource management issues** - multiple objects may try to free same resources
4. **Performance cost** - copying large objects is expensive

**When Returning Objects:**
1. **Temporary objects** are created and destroyed
2. **Multiple destructor calls** - local object, temporary object, and destination object
3. **Resource management problems** - same memory freed multiple times
4. **Shallow copy issues** - pointers copied, not pointed-to data

**Solutions:**
- Use **pass-by-reference** or **pass-by-pointer** when appropriate
- Implement **copy constructors** for resource-managing classes
- Consider **return by reference** when possible
- Use **smart pointers** in modern C++

### 7. **Friend Function Definition**
**Question:** What is a friend function?

**Answer:** A **friend function** is a non-member function that has been granted access to the private and protected members of a class. Key characteristics:

- **Not a member** of the class
- **Declared with `friend` keyword** inside the class
- **Can access private members** through objects of the class
- **Cannot be called** using object.function() syntax
- **Not inherited** by derived classes
- **Can be friend to multiple classes**

**Purpose:**
- Operator overloading
- Special I/O operations
- Functions needing access to multiple classes' private data
- Utility functions that need intimate access to class internals

---

## Summary

**Key Friend Function Concepts:**
1. **Declaration**: Inside class with `friend` keyword
2. **Definition**: Regular function (no `friend` keyword)
3. **Access**: Private members through objects only
4. **Calling**: Regular function call syntax
5. **Inheritance**: Not inherited by derived classes
6. **Multiple classes**: Can be friend to several classes
7. **Forward declaration**: Needed for circular dependencies
8. **Scope resolution**: Used when member function is friend of another class

**Best Practices:**
- Use sparingly - breaks encapsulation
- Consider alternatives like public member functions
- Document friend relationships clearly
- Be careful with resource management in friend functions
