# 3.2 PASSING OBJECTS TO FUNCTIONS

## Overview
Objects can be passed to functions as arguments in the same way that other types of data are passed. Simply declare the function's parameter as a class type and then use an object of that class as an argument when calling the function. **By default, all objects are passed by value to a function.**

---

## Example 1: Basic Object Passing

This example demonstrates passing an object to a function by value:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class samp {
    int i;
public:
    samp(int n) { i = n; }
    int get_i() { return i; }
};

// Return square of o.i.
int sqr_it(samp o) {
    return o.get_i() * o.get_i();
}

int main() {
    samp a(10), b(2);
    cout << sqr_it(a) << "\n";  // Output: 100
    cout << sqr_it(b) << "\n";  // Output: 4
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The `samp` class contains one integer variable `i`
- The `sqr_it()` function takes an argument of type `samp` and returns the square of that object's `i` value
- When `sqr_it(a)` is called, object `a` is passed by value (a copy is made)
- The output is 100 (10²) followed by 4 (2²)

---

## Example 2: Pass by Value - No Effect on Original Object

This example shows that changes to the object inside the function do not affect the calling object:

```cpp
/*
Remember, objects, like other parameters, are passed
by value. Thus changes to the parameter inside a
function have no effect on the object used in the call.
*/
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class samp {
    int i;
public:
    samp(int n) { i = n; }
    void set_i(int n) { i = n; }
    int get_i() { return i; }
};

/*
Set o.i to its square. This has no effect on the
object used to call sqr_it(), however.
*/
void sqr_it(samp o) {
    o.set_i(o.get_i() * o.get_i());
    cout << "Copy of a has i value of " << o.get_i();
}

int main() {
    samp a(10);
    sqr_it(a);  // a passed by value
    cout << "But, a.i is unchanged in main: ";
    cout << a.get_i();  // displays 10
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Copy of a has i value of 100
But, a.i is unchanged in main: 10
```

**Explanation:**
- When `sqr_it(a)` is called, a copy of object `a` is created
- The function modifies the copy's `i` value to 100
- The original object `a` in `main()` remains unchanged with value 10
- This demonstrates that pass-by-value creates a separate copy

---

## Example 3: Passing Object Address (Pass by Reference)

This example shows how to modify the original object by passing its address:

```cpp
/*
Now that the address of an object is passed to sqr_it(),
the function can modify the value of the argument whose
address is used in the call.
*/
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class samp {
    int i;
public:
    samp(int n) { i = n; }
    void set_i(int n) { i = n; }
    int get_i() { return i; }
};

/*
Set o.i to its square. This affects the calling
argument.
*/
void sqr_it(samp *o) {
    o->set_i(o->get_i() * o->get_i());
    cout << "Copy of a has i value of " << o->get_i();
    cout << "\n";
}

int main() {
    samp a(10);
    sqr_it(&a);  // pass a's address to sqr_it()
    cout << "Now, a in main() has been changed: ";
    cout << a.get_i();  // displays 100
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Copy of a has i value of 100
Now, a in main() has been changed: 100
```

**Explanation:**
- The function parameter is now `samp *o` (pointer to samp)
- We pass `&a` (address of a) instead of `a` itself
- The function uses arrow operator `->` to access members through the pointer
- Now the original object `a` is modified, showing value 100 in main()

---

## Example 4: Constructor and Destructor Behavior

This crucial example demonstrates when constructors and destructors are called during object passing:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class samp {
    int i;
public:
    samp(int n) {
        i = n;
        cout << "Constructing\n";
    }
    ~samp() { cout << "Destructing\n"; }
    int get_i() { return i; }
};

// Return square of o.i.
int sqr_it(samp o) {
    return o.get_i() * o.get_i();
}

int main() {
    samp a(10);
    cout << sqr_it(a) << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Constructing
100
Destructing
Destructing
```

**Key Points:**
1. **Constructor called once**: Only when object `a` is created in `main()`
2. **Destructor called twice**: 
   - Once for the copy created when `a` is passed to `sqr_it()`
   - Once for the original object `a` when `main()` ends

**Important Rule:**
- When a copy of an object is made for function parameter passing, the **constructor is NOT called**
- When the function terminates and the copy is destroyed, the **destructor IS called**
- This prevents initialization of an already existing object's copy
- The destructor is called because the copy may need cleanup when going out of scope

---

## Potential Problems and Solutions

### Problem: Destructor Side Effects
The fact that the destructor is called for the copy can cause problems, especially when:
- The object allocates dynamic memory
- The destructor frees that memory
- Both the original and copy try to free the same memory

### Solutions:
1. **Pass by address**: No new object is created, so no destructor is called
2. **Copy constructor**: Define precisely how copies are made (covered in Chapter 5)
3. **Reference parameters**: An elegant alternative (covered in next chapter)

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Stack Display Function
**Task:** Using the stack example from Section 3.1, Example 2, add a function called `showstack()` that is passed an object of type stack. Have this function display the contents of a stack.

**Solution Approach:**
```cpp
void showstack(stack s) {
    // This function would receive a copy of the stack
    // and display its contents without modifying the original
    // Implementation would depend on the stack class structure
}
```

### Exercise 2: Identifying the Error
**Task:** What is wrong with the following program?

```cpp
// This program contains an error.
#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
using namespace std;

class dyna {
    int *p;
public:
    dyna(int i);
    ~dyna() { free(p); cout << "freeing\n"; }
    int get() { return *p; }
};

dyna::dyna(int i) {
    p = (int *) malloc(sizeof(int));
    if (!p) {
        cout << "Allocation failure\n";
        exit(1);
    }
    *p = i;
}

// Return negative value of *ob.p
int neg(dyna ob) {
    return -ob.get();
}

int main() {
    dyna o(-10);
    cout << o.get() << "\n";
    cout << neg(o) << "\n";
    dyna o2(20);
    cout << o2.get() << "\n";
    cout << neg(o2) << "\n";
    cout << o.get() << "\n";    // Problem occurs here
    cout << neg(o) << "\n";     // Problem occurs here
    return 0;
}
```

**The Error:**
1. When `neg(o)` is called, a copy of object `o` is created
2. Both the original `o` and the copy point to the same memory location
3. When `neg()` returns, the copy's destructor is called, which frees the memory
4. The original object `o` now has a dangling pointer
5. Subsequent calls to `o.get()` or `neg(o)` access freed memory, causing undefined behavior

**The Problem Sequence:**
- `o` is created, `p` points to allocated memory
- `neg(o)` is called, copy is made with same `p` value
- Copy's destructor frees the memory when `neg()` returns
- Original `o` still exists but `p` now points to freed memory
- Any further use of `o` results in undefined behavior

**Solutions:**
1. Pass by pointer: `int neg(dyna *ob) { return -ob->get(); }`
2. Implement proper copy constructor to allocate separate memory
3. Use reference parameters (next chapter)
4. Implement copy constructor and assignment operator properly

## Summary

**Key Takeaways:**
1. Objects are passed by value by default (copies are made)
2. Changes to copies don't affect original objects
3. Pass addresses to modify original objects
4. Constructor is NOT called when making copies for parameters
5. Destructor IS called when parameter copies are destroyed
6. Be careful with objects that manage resources (memory, files, etc.)
7. Consider pass-by-pointer or copy constructors for complex objects
