/*
2. It is important to understand that all data members of one object are assigned to another
when an assignment is performed. This includes compound data such as arrays. For
example, in the following version of the stack example, only s1 has any characters actually
pushed onto it. However, because of the assignment, s2â€™s stck array will also contain the
characters a, b, and c.
