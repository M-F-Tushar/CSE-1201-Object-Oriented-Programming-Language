# 13.4 const Member Functions and mutable

## Overview

Class member functions can be declared as `const`, which provides important guarantees about the behavior of those functions. This feature is crucial for writing safe, predictable code and supporting const-correctness in C++.

## Key Concepts

### const Member Functions

When a member function is declared as `const`:
- **It cannot modify the object that invokes it**
- **A const object can only call const member functions**
- **A const member function can be called by both const and non-const objects**

### Syntax

```cpp
class X {
    int some_var;
public:
    int f1() const;  // const member function
};
```

**Important**: The `const` keyword appears **after** the function's parameter declaration.

### The mutable Keyword

Sometimes you need a `const` member function to modify specific members while keeping others protected. The `mutable` keyword allows this:
- **mutable members can be modified by const member functions**
- **It overrides const-ness for specific data members**
- **Other non-mutable members remain protected**

## Detailed Examples

### Example 1: Basic const Member Function Behavior

This example demonstrates why const member functions are important and shows a compilation error:

```cpp
/* Demonstrate const member functions.
   This program won't compile. */
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Demo {
    int i;
public:
    int geti() const {
        return i;  // OK - reading is allowed
    }
    
    void seti(int x) const {
        i = x;  // ERROR! Cannot modify member in const function
    }
};

int main() {
    Demo ob;
    ob.seti(1900);
    cout << ob.geti();
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation**:
- `geti()` is declared `const` and only reads the value of `i` - this is perfectly acceptable
- `seti()` is declared `const` but attempts to modify `i` - this causes a compilation error
- The compiler enforces that const member functions cannot change the object's state

### Example 2: Using mutable to Allow Selective Modification

This example shows how `mutable` allows specific members to be modified by const functions:

```cpp
// Demonstrate mutable
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Demo {
    mutable int i;  // Can be modified by const functions
    int j;          // Cannot be modified by const functions
public:
    int geti() const {
        return i;  // OK - reading is always allowed
    }
    
    void seti(int x) const {
        i = x;  // OK - i is mutable
    }
    
    /* This function won't compile:
    void setj(int x) const {
        j = x;  // ERROR! j is not mutable
    }
    */
};

int main() {
    Demo ob;
    ob.seti(1900);
    cout << ob.geti();
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation**:
- `i` is declared `mutable`, so `seti()` can modify it even though `seti()` is `const`
- `j` is not mutable, so any const function attempting to modify it would cause a compilation error
- This allows fine-grained control over which members can be modified by const functions

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Fixing the CountDown Timer

**Problem**: The following program attempts to create a countdown timer but won't compile. Fix it:

```cpp
// This program contains an error.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class CountDown {
    int incr;
    int target;
    int current;
public:
    CountDown(int delay, int i=1) {
        target = delay;
        incr = i;
        current = 0;
    }
    
    bool counting() const {
        current += incr;  // ERROR: modifying current in const function
        if(current >= target) {
            cout << "\a";
            return false;
        }
        cout << current << " ";
        return true;
    }
};

int main() {
    CountDown ob(100, 2);
    while(ob.counting());
    return 0;
}
```

**Solution**:

```cpp
// Fixed version
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class CountDown {
    int incr;
    int target;
    mutable int current;  // Make current mutable
public:
    CountDown(int delay, int i=1) {
        target = delay;
        incr = i;
        current = 0;
    }
    
    bool counting() const {
        current += incr;  // Now OK - current is mutable
        if(current >= target) {
            cout << "\a";
            return false;
        }
        cout << current << " ";
        return true;
    }
};

int main() {
    CountDown ob(100, 2);
    while(ob.counting());
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation of the Fix**:
- The problem was that `counting()` is declared `const` but needs to modify `current`
- By declaring `current` as `mutable`, we allow the const function to modify it
- This makes sense because updating the current count is part of the timer's internal state management, not a modification of the timer's core properties (target and increment)

### Exercise 2: Can a const member function call a non-const function?

**Question**: Can a const member function call a non-const member function? Why not?

**Answer**: 

**No**, a const member function **cannot** call a non-const member function of the same object.

**Reasoning**:
1. **Const Contract**: When a function is declared `const`, it promises not to modify the object
2. **Non-const Functions**: Non-const member functions are allowed to modify the object
3. **Contract Violation**: If a const function could call a non-const function, it could indirectly modify the object, breaking its const promise
4. **Compiler Enforcement**: The compiler prevents this to maintain const-correctness

**Example**:
```cpp
class Example {
    int value;
public:
    void modify() {           // Non-const function
        value = 100;
    }
    
    void display() const {
        // modify();          // ERROR! Cannot call non-const from const
        cout << value;        // OK - just reading
    }
};
```

## Best Practices

### When to Use const Member Functions
1. **Accessor Functions**: Functions that only read data should be const
2. **Query Functions**: Functions that check state without changing it
3. **Display Functions**: Functions that output data without modification

### When to Use mutable
1. **Caching**: When you want to cache computed values for performance
2. **Logging**: When you need to log access to const objects
3. **Reference Counting**: For internal bookkeeping that doesn't affect logical state
4. **Lazy Initialization**: When you want to initialize expensive resources only when needed

### Example of Good Design
```cpp
class BankAccount {
    double balance;
    mutable int access_count;  // For statistics, doesn't affect account state
    
public:
    double getBalance() const {
        access_count++;        // OK - mutable member
        return balance;        // OK - just reading
    }
    
    void deposit(double amount) {  // Non-const - modifies balance
        balance += amount;
    }
};
```

## Summary

- **const member functions** provide guarantees that they won't modify the object
- Only **const member functions** can be called on const objects
- **mutable members** can be modified even by const member functions
- **const member functions cannot call non-const member functions** on the same object
- This system ensures **const-correctness** and helps prevent accidental modifications
