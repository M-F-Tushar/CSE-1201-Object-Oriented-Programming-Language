# C++ Virtual Base Classes - Complete Guide

## 1. The Diamond Problem

### Problem Description
When multiple inheritance creates a diamond-shaped hierarchy, ambiguity arises. Consider this structure:

```
     Base
    /    \
Derived1  Derived2
    \    /
   Derived3
```

**Issue:** `Derived3` inherits `Base` twice:
- Once through `Derived1`
- Once through `Derived2`

**Result:** Ambiguous references to `Base` members in `Derived3`

### Solution: Virtual Base Classes
Use the `virtual` keyword to ensure only one copy of the base class exists in the final derived class.

**Syntax:**
```cpp
class derived_class : virtual access_specifier base_class
```

## 2. Detailed Examples

### Example 1: Virtual Base Class Solution

```cpp
// This program uses a virtual base class
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base
{
public:
    int i;
};

// Inherit base as virtual
class derived1 : virtual public base
{
public:
    int j;
};

// Inherit base as virtual here, too
class derived2 : virtual public base
{
public:
    int k;
};

/*
Here, derived3 inherits both derived1 and derived2.
However, only one copy of base is present.
*/
class derived3 : public derived1, public derived2
{
public:
    int product() { return i * j * k; }
};

int main()
{
    derived3 ob;
    ob.i = 10;  // unambiguous because only one copy present
    ob.j = 3;
    ob.k = 5;
    cout << "Product is " << ob.product() << '\n';  // Output: Product is 150
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Virtual Inheritance**: Both `derived1` and `derived2` inherit `base` as `virtual`
- **Single Copy**: Only one instance of `base` exists in `derived3`
- **Unambiguous Access**: `ob.i = 10` works without ambiguity
- **Functionality**: `product()` can access `i`, `j`, and `k` without issues

**Without Virtual Inheritance:**
```cpp
// This would cause compilation errors
class derived1 : public base  // NOT virtual
class derived2 : public base  // NOT virtual
// ob.i = 10; would be ambiguous - which base::i?
```

### Example 2: Virtual Base Class Behavior

```cpp
// Demonstrating that virtual base still exists in individual derived classes
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base
{
public:
    int i;
    base() { cout << "Base constructor called\n"; }
};

class derived1 : virtual public base
{
public:
    int j;
    derived1() { cout << "Derived1 constructor called\n"; }
};

class derived2 : virtual public base
{
public:
    int k;
    derived2() { cout << "Derived2 constructor called\n"; }
};

class derived3 : public derived1, public derived2
{
public:
    derived3() { cout << "Derived3 constructor called\n"; }
};

int main()
{
    cout << "Creating derived1 object:\n";
    derived1 ob1;
    ob1.i = 100;  // Perfectly valid - base exists in derived1
    cout << "ob1.i = " << ob1.i << "\n\n";
    
    cout << "Creating derived3 object:\n";
    derived3 ob3;
    ob3.i = 200;  // Only one copy of base::i exists
    cout << "ob3.i = " << ob3.i << "\n";
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Creating derived1 object:
Base constructor called
Derived1 constructor called
ob1.i = 100

Creating derived3 object:
Base constructor called
Derived1 constructor called
Derived2 constructor called
Derived3 constructor called
ob3.i = 200
```

**Key Points:**
- Virtual base class still exists in individual derived classes
- Base constructor called only once even in diamond inheritance
- Virtual inheritance only affects multiple inheritance scenarios

## 3. Exercises with Solutions

### Exercise 1: Remove Virtual Keyword

**Task:** Remove the `virtual` keyword from Example 1 and observe compilation errors.

**Modified Code:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base
{
public:
    int i;
};

// Remove virtual keyword
class derived1 : public base  // Was: virtual public base
{
public:
    int j;
};

// Remove virtual keyword
class derived2 : public base  // Was: virtual public base
{
public:
    int k;
};

class derived3 : public derived1, public derived2
{
public:
    int product() { return i * j * k; }  // ERROR: ambiguous
};

int main()
{
    derived3 ob;
    ob.i = 10;  // ERROR: ambiguous - which base::i?
    ob.j = 3;
    ob.k = 5;
    cout << "Product is " << ob.product() << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

**Compilation Errors:**
```
error: request for member 'i' is ambiguous
note: candidates are:
  'int base::i' in 'derived1'
  'int base::i' in 'derived2'

error: 'i' is an ambiguous base of 'derived3'
```

**Explanation:**
- `derived3` contains two copies of `base`
- Compiler cannot determine which `base::i` to use
- Must explicitly specify: `ob.derived1::i` or `ob.derived2::i`

### Exercise 2: Why Virtual Base Classes Are Necessary

**Answer:**
Virtual base classes are necessary to resolve the **diamond problem** in multiple inheritance:

1. **Ambiguity Resolution**: When a class inherits the same base class through multiple paths, virtual inheritance ensures only one copy exists

2. **Memory Efficiency**: Prevents duplicate storage of base class data

3. **Logical Consistency**: Maintains the intended class hierarchy semantics

4. **Avoiding Compilation Errors**: Eliminates ambiguous member access errors

**Example Scenario:**
```cpp
class Animal { public: string name; };
class Mammal : virtual public Animal { };
class Bird : virtual public Animal { };
class Bat : public Mammal, public Bird { };  // Flying mammal

// Without virtual inheritance:
// Bat would have TWO Animal::name members - illogical!
```

### Question 1: Building Hierarchy

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class building
{
protected:
    int floors;
    int rooms;
    int square_footage;
    
public:
    building(int f, int r, int sf) : floors(f), rooms(r), square_footage(sf) {}
    
    void show_building()
    {
        cout << "Floors: " << floors << endl;
        cout << "Rooms: " << rooms << endl;
        cout << "Square Footage: " << square_footage << endl;
    }
};

class house : public building
{
private:
    int bedrooms;
    int bathrooms;
    
public:
    house(int f, int r, int sf, int bed, int bath) 
        : building(f, r, sf), bedrooms(bed), bathrooms(bath) {}
    
    void show_house()
    {
        show_building();
        cout << "Bedrooms: " << bedrooms << endl;
        cout << "Bathrooms: " << bathrooms << endl;
    }
};

class office : public building
{
private:
    int fire_extinguishers;
    int telephones;
    
public:
    office(int f, int r, int sf, int ext, int tel)
        : building(f, r, sf), fire_extinguishers(ext), telephones(tel) {}
    
    void show_office()
    {
        show_building();
        cout << "Fire Extinguishers: " << fire_extinguishers << endl;
        cout << "Telephones: " << telephones << endl;
    }
};

int main()
{
    house h(2, 8, 2500, 4, 3);
    office o(10, 100, 50000, 20, 150);
    
    cout << "House Details:\n";
    h.show_house();
    cout << "\nOffice Details:\n";
    o.show_office();
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Question 2: Inheritance Access Specifiers

**Public Inheritance (`public`):**
- **Base's public members** → Become public in derived class
- **Base's private members** → Remain inaccessible in derived class

**Private Inheritance (`private`):**
- **Base's public members** → Become private in derived class
- **Base's private members** → Remain inaccessible in derived class

### Question 3: Protected Access Specifier

**As a Member Access Specifier:**
- **Protected members** are accessible to:
  - The class itself
  - Derived classes
  - NOT accessible to external code

**As an Inheritance Access Specifier:**
- **Protected inheritance** makes:
  - Base's public members → Protected in derived class
  - Base's protected members → Protected in derived class
  - Base's private members → Inaccessible in derived class

### Question 4: Constructor/Destructor Call Order

**Constructor Order:**
1. Base class constructor(s) called first
2. Derived class constructor called last
3. In multiple inheritance: left-to-right order

**Destructor Order:**
1. Derived class destructor called first
2. Base class destructor(s) called last
3. In multiple inheritance: reverse order (right-to-left)

### Question 5: Planet/Earth Class Implementation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class planet
{
protected:
    double distance;  // miles from the sun
    int revolve;     // in days
public:
    planet(double d, int r) { distance = d; revolve = r; }
};

class earth : public planet
{
    double circumference;  // circumference of orbit
public:
    // Constructor: pass distance and days to planet, compute circumference
    earth(double d, int r) : planet(d, r)
    {
        circumference = 2 * distance * 3.1416;
    }
    
    // Display function
    void show()
    {
        cout << "Distance from Sun: " << distance << " miles\n";
        cout << "Days to revolve: " << revolve << " days\n";
        cout << "Orbit circumference: " << circumference << " miles\n";
    }
};

int main()
{
    earth ob(93000000, 365);
    ob.show();
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Distance from Sun: 93000000 miles
Days to revolve: 365 days
Orbit circumference: 5.84336e+08 miles
```

### Question 6: Vehicle Hierarchy Fix

**Problem:** Multiple inheritance diamond problem - `car` inherits `vehicle` through both `motorized` and `road_use`.

**Solution:** Make `vehicle` a virtual base class:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// A base class for various types of vehicles
class vehicle
{
    int num_wheels;
    int range;
public:
    vehicle(int w, int r)
    {
        num_wheels = w;
        range = r;
    }
    void showv()
    {
        cout << "Wheels: " << num_wheels << '\n';
        cout << "Range: " << range << '\n';
    }
};

enum motor {gas, electric, diesel};

// Make vehicle a virtual base class
class motorized : virtual public vehicle
{
    enum motor mtr;
public:
    motorized(enum motor m, int w, int r) : vehicle(w, r)
    {
        mtr = m;
    }
    void showm()
    {
        cout << "Motor: ";
        switch(mtr)
        {
            case gas: cout << "Gas\n"; break;
            case electric: cout << "Electric\n"; break;
            case diesel: cout << "Diesel\n"; break;
        }
    }
};

// Make vehicle a virtual base class
class road_use : virtual public vehicle
{
    int passengers;
public:
    road_use(int p, int w, int r) : vehicle(w, r)
    {
        passengers = p;
    }
    void showr()
    {
        cout << "Passengers: " << passengers << '\n';
    }
};

enum steering {power, rack_pinion, manual};

class car : public motorized, public road_use
{
    enum steering strng;
public:
    // Must call vehicle constructor explicitly in virtual inheritance
    car(enum steering s, enum motor m, int w, int r, int p) :
        vehicle(w, r), motorized(m, w, r), road_use(p, w, r)
    {
        strng = s;
    }
    
    void show()
    {
        showv();
        showr();
        showm();
        cout << "Steering: ";
        switch(strng)
        {
            case power: cout << "Power\n"; break;
            case rack_pinion: cout << "Rack and Pinion\n"; break;
            case manual: cout << "Manual\n"; break;
        }
    }
};

int main()
{
    car c(power, gas, 4, 500, 5);
    c.show();
    return 0;
}
```

**Key Changes:**
1. Added `virtual` keyword to both `motorized` and `road_use` inheritance
2. Modified `car` constructor to explicitly call `vehicle(w, r)` first
3. This ensures only one copy of `vehicle` exists in `car` objects

**Output:**
```
Wheels: 4
Range: 500
Passengers: 5
Motor: Gas
Steering: Power
```
