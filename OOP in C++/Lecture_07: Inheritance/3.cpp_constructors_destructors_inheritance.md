# C++ Constructors, Destructors, and Inheritance

## 7.3 CONSTRUCTORS, DESTRUCTORS, AND INHERITANCE

### Overview

When both base class and derived class have constructor and/or destructor functions, specific rules govern their execution order and argument passing.

### Execution Order Rules

| Function Type | Execution Order | Reason |
|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Constructors** | Base → Derived | Base class initialization is prerequisite to derived class |
| **Destructors** | Derived → Base | Derived class must be destroyed before its foundation (base) |

### Key Principles

1. **Constructor Order**: Base class constructor executes **before** derived class constructor
2. **Destructor Order**: Derived class destructor executes **before** base class destructor
3. **Logical Reasoning**: 
   - Base class has no knowledge of derived class
   - Base class initialization is often prerequisite to derived class
   - Derived class depends on base class, so base must be destroyed last

### Argument Passing Syntax

When passing arguments to base class constructor:

```cpp
derived_constructor(arg_list) : base(arg_list)
{
    // body of derived class constructor
}
```

Where:
- `base` is the name of the base class
- Both derived and base class can use the same argument
- Derived class can ignore arguments and just pass them along

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Basic Constructor and Destructor Order

This program demonstrates the execution order of constructors and destructors:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base
{
public:
    base() { cout << "Constructing base class\n"; }
    ~base() { cout << "Destructing base class\n"; }
};

class derived : public base
{
public:
    derived() { cout << "Constructing derived class\n"; }
    ~derived() { cout << "Destructing derived class\n"; }
};

int main()
{
    derived o;
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**
```
Constructing base class
Constructing derived class
Destructing derived class
Destructing base class
```

**Explanation:**
- When `derived o` is created, `base()` constructor runs first, then `derived()` constructor
- When `o` goes out of scope at the end of `main()`, `~derived()` destructor runs first, then `~base()` destructor
- This demonstrates the fundamental rule: constructors in derivation order, destructors in reverse order

### Example 2: Passing Arguments to Derived Class Constructor

This program shows how to pass arguments to a derived class constructor:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base
{
public:
    base() { cout << "Constructing base class\n"; }
    ~base() { cout << "Destructing base class\n"; }
};

class derived : public base
{
    int j;
public:
    derived(int n)
    {
        cout << "Constructing derived class\n";
        j = n;
    }
    ~derived() { cout << "Destructing derived class\n"; }
    void showj() { cout << j << '\n'; }
};

int main()
{
    derived o(10);
    o.showj();
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The derived class constructor takes an argument `n` and uses it to initialize member `j`
- The base class constructor is still called automatically (default constructor)
- The argument is passed to the derived class constructor in normal fashion: `derived o(10)`
- Construction order remains: base constructor first, then derived constructor

### Example 3: Passing Same Argument to Both Constructors

This example shows both base and derived class constructors taking the same argument:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base
{
    int i;
public:
    base(int n)
    {
        cout << "Constructing base class\n";
        i = n;
    }
    ~base() { cout << "Destructing base class\n"; }
    void showi() { cout << i << '\n'; }
};

class derived : public base
{
    int j;
public:
    derived(int n) : base(n)  // pass arg to base class
    {
        cout << "Constructing derived class\n";
        j = n;
    }
    ~derived() { cout << "Destructing derived class\n"; }
    void showj() { cout << j << '\n'; }
};

int main()
{
    derived o(10);
    o.showi();
    o.showj();
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- **Key syntax**: `derived(int n) : base(n)` - this passes argument `n` to base class constructor
- The parameter `n` is used by both constructors: `base(n)` and within `derived()` to initialize `j`
- Both `i` and `j` will be set to 10
- The `: base(n)` part is called the **member initialization list**

### Example 4: Different Arguments for Base and Derived Constructors

This program shows how to pass different arguments to base and derived class constructors:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base
{
    int i;
public:
    base(int n)
    {
        cout << "Constructing base class\n";
        i = n;
    }
    ~base() { cout << "Destructing base class\n"; }
    void showi() { cout << i << '\n'; }
};

class derived : public base
{
    int j;
public:
    derived(int n, int m) : base(m)  // pass arg to base class
    {
        cout << "Constructing derived class\n";
        j = n;
    }
    ~derived() { cout << "Destructing derived class\n"; }
    void showj() { cout << j << '\n'; }
};

int main()
{
    derived o(10, 20);
    o.showi();   // prints 20
    o.showj();   // prints 10
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- Derived constructor takes two parameters: `n` and `m`
- Parameter `m` is passed to base class constructor: `base(m)`
- Parameter `n` is used by derived class to initialize `j`
- When called with `derived o(10, 20)`:
  - `n = 10` (used for `j`)
  - `m = 20` (passed to base for `i`)

### Example 5: Derived Class Ignoring Arguments

This example shows a derived class that doesn't use an argument but passes it to the base class:

```cpp
class base
{
    int i;
public:
    base(int n)
    {
        cout << "Constructing base class\n";
        i = n;
    }
    ~base() { cout << "Destructing base class\n"; }
    void showi() { cout << i << '\n'; }
};

class derived : public base
{
    int j;
public:
    derived(int n) : base(n)  // pass arg to base class
    {
        cout << "Constructing derived class\n";
        j = 0;  // j is hardcoded, n is not used here
    }
    ~derived() { cout << "Destructing derived class\n"; }
    void showj() { cout << j << '\n'; }
};
```

**Explanation:**
- The derived class constructor receives parameter `n` but doesn't use it for its own initialization
- Instead, it passes `n` directly to the base class constructor
- The derived class sets `j = 0` regardless of the argument value
- This pattern is useful when the derived class doesn't need the argument but the base class does

## EXERCISES

### Exercise 1: String Constructor with Length Calculation

**Question**: Given the following skeleton, fill in the constructor function for myderived. Have it pass along a pointer to an initialization string to mybase. Also, have myderived() initialize len to the length of the string.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

class mybase
{
    char str[80];
public:
    mybase(char *s) { strcpy(str, s); }
    char *get() { return str; }
};

class myderived : public mybase
{
    int len;
public:
    // add myderived() here
    int getlen() { return len; }
    void show() { cout << get() << '\n'; }
};

int main()
{
    myderived ob("hello");
    ob.show();
    cout << ob.getlen() << '\n';
    return 0;
}
```

**Solution:**

```cpp
class myderived : public mybase
{
    int len;
public:
    myderived(char *s) : mybase(s)
    {
        len = strlen(s);
    }
    int getlen() { return len; }
    void show() { cout << get() << '\n'; }
};
```

**Explanation:**
- **Constructor signature**: `myderived(char *s)` - takes a string pointer
- **Base class call**: `: mybase(s)` - passes the string to base class constructor
- **Length calculation**: `len = strlen(s)` - calculates and stores string length
- **Execution flow**:
  1. `mybase(s)` constructor runs first, copies string to `str`
  2. `myderived` constructor runs, calculates length
  3. Object is fully constructed

**Expected Output:**
```
hello
5
```

### Exercise 2: Vehicle Inheritance with Multiple Arguments

**Question**: Using the following skeleton, create appropriate car() and truck() constructor functions. Have each pass along appropriate arguments to vehicle. In addition, have car() initialize passengers as specified when object is created. Have truck() initialize loadlimit as specified when an object is created.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// A base class for various types of vehicle
class vehicle
{
    int num_wheels;
    int range;
public:
    vehicle(int w, int r)
    {
        num_wheels = w;
        range = r;
    }
    void showv()
    {
        cout << "Wheels: " << num_wheels << '\n';
        cout << "Range: " << range << '\n';
    }
};

class car : public vehicle
{
    int passengers;
public:
    // insert car() constructor here
    void show()
    {
        showv();
        cout << "Passengers: " << passengers << '\n';
    }
};

class truck : public vehicle
{
    int loadlimit;
public:
    // insert truck() constructor here
    void show()
    {
        showv();
        cout << "Loadlimit: " << loadlimit << '\n';
    }
};

int main()
{
    car c(5, 4, 500);
    truck t(3000, 12, 1200);
    cout << "Car:\n";
    c.show();
    cout << "\nTruck:\n";
    t.show();
    return 0;
}
```

**Required object creation format:**
- `car ob(passengers, wheels, range);`
- `truck ob(loadlimit, wheels, range);`

**Solution:**

```cpp
class car : public vehicle
{
    int passengers;
public:
    car(int p, int w, int r) : vehicle(w, r)
    {
        passengers = p;
    }
    void show()
    {
        showv();
        cout << "Passengers: " << passengers << '\n';
    }
};

class truck : public vehicle
{
    int loadlimit;
public:
    truck(int l, int w, int r) : vehicle(w, r)
    {
        loadlimit = l;
    }
    void show()
    {
        showv();
        cout << "Loadlimit: " << loadlimit << '\n';
    }
};
```

**Explanation:**

#### Car Constructor:
- **Parameters**: `p` (passengers), `w` (wheels), `r` (range)
- **Base class call**: `: vehicle(w, r)` - passes wheels and range to vehicle constructor
- **Derived initialization**: `passengers = p` - sets passenger count

#### Truck Constructor:
- **Parameters**: `l` (loadlimit), `w` (wheels), `r` (range)
- **Base class call**: `: vehicle(w, r)` - passes wheels and range to vehicle constructor
- **Derived initialization**: `loadlimit = l` - sets load limit

#### Execution Flow:
1. `car c(5, 4, 500)` creates car with 5 passengers, 4 wheels, 500 range
2. `vehicle(4, 500)` constructor runs first
3. `car` constructor runs, sets passengers = 5
4. Similar process for truck

**Expected Output:**
```
Car:
Wheels: 4
Range: 500
Passengers: 5

Truck:
Wheels: 12
Range: 1200
Loadlimit: 3000
```

## Constructor/Destructor Best Practices

### 1. **Always Use Member Initialization Lists**
```cpp
// Preferred
derived(int n) : base(n), member(value) { }

// Avoid
derived(int n) : base(n) { member = value; }
```

### 2. **Handle Multiple Inheritance Carefully**
```cpp
class derived : public base1, public base2
{
public:
    derived(int a, int b) : base1(a), base2(b) { }
};
```

### 3. **Exception Safety**
- Base class constructors run first
- If derived constructor throws, base destructor is called
- Use RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles

### 4. **Virtual Destructors**
```cpp
class base
{
public:
    virtual ~base() { }  // Virtual destructor for polymorphism
};
```

## Summary

Key concepts for constructors and destructors in inheritance:

1. **Execution Order**: Constructors (base→derived), Destructors (derived→base)
2. **Argument Passing**: Use member initialization list syntax `: base(args)`
3. **Flexibility**: Derived class can use, ignore, or transform arguments before passing to base
4. **Automatic Calls**: Base constructors/destructors are called automatically
5. **Design Principle**: Ensure proper initialization chain and cleanup order

Understanding these concepts is crucial for building robust inheritance hierarchies and avoiding common pitfalls in C++ object-oriented programming.
