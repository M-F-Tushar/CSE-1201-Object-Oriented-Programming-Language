# C++ Inheritance: Base Class Access Control

## 7.1 BASE CLASS ACCESS CONTROL

### Basic Syntax

When one class inherits another, it uses this general form:

```cpp
class derived_class_name : access base_class_name
{
    // ...
}
```

Where `access` is one of three keywords: `public`, `private`, or `protected`.

### Access Specifier Rules

The access specifier determines how elements of the base class are inherited by the derived class:

- **Public Inheritance**: All public members of the base become public members of the derived class
- **Private Inheritance**: All public members of the base class become private members of the derived class
- **Important**: Private members of the base class remain private to it and are inaccessible by the derived class in both cases

### Key Points

- If the access specifier is private, public members of the base become private members of the derived class, but these members are still accessible by member functions of the derived class
- Access is optional - defaults to private for classes, public for structs
- Most programmers explicitly specify access for clarity

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Public Inheritance

This example demonstrates public inheritance where base class public members remain public in the derived class:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base
{
    int x;                          // Private member
public:
    void setx(int n) { x = n; }     // Public member
    void showx() { cout << x << '\n'; }  // Public member
};

// Inherit as public
class derived : public base
{
    int y;                          // Private member
public:
    void sety(int n) { y = n; }     // Public member
    void showy() { cout << y << '\n'; }  // Public member
};

int main()
{
    derived ob;
    ob.setx(10);    // Access member of base class - LEGAL
    ob.sety(20);    // Access member of derived class - LEGAL
    ob.showx();     // Access member of base class - LEGAL
    ob.showy();     // Access member of derived class - LEGAL
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation**: Because `base` is inherited as public, the public members `setx()` and `showx()` become public members of `derived` and are accessible from anywhere in the program, including `main()`.

### Example 2: Attempting to Access Private Base Members (ERROR)

This example shows what happens when a derived class tries to access private members of the base class:

```cpp
class base
{
    int x;                          // Private member
public:
    void setx(int n) { x = n; }
    void showx() { cout << x << '\n'; }
};

// Inherit as public - this has an error!
class derived : public base
{
    int y;
public:
    void sety(int n) { y = n; }
    
    /*
    Cannot access private member of base class.
    x is a private member of base and not available
    within derived.
    */
    void show_sum() { cout << x+y << '\n'; } // ERROR!
    
    void showy() { cout << y << '\n'; }
};
```

**Explanation**: Even with public inheritance, the derived class cannot access private members of the base class. The variable `x` is private to `base` and remains inaccessible to `derived`, regardless of the inheritance type.

### Example 3: Private Inheritance (ERROR in main())

This example demonstrates private inheritance and its consequences:

```cpp
// This program contains an error
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base
{
    int x;
public:
    void setx(int n) { x = n; }
    void showx() { cout << x << '\n'; }
};

// Inherit base as private
class derived : private base
{
    int y;
public:
    void sety(int n) { y = n; }
    void showy() { cout << y << '\n'; }
};

int main()
{
    derived ob;
    ob.setx(10);    // ERROR - now private to derived class
    ob.sety(20);    // OK - access member of derived class
    ob.showx();     // ERROR - now private to derived class
    ob.showy();     // OK - access member of derived class
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation**: With private inheritance, `showx()` and `setx()` become private to `derived` and are not accessible outside of it. However, they remain public within `base` itself.

**Important Note**: 
```cpp
base base_ob;
base_ob.setx(1); // Legal because base_ob is of type base
```
This would be legal because `setx()` is public within `base`.

### Example 4: Accessing Private-Inherited Members Within Derived Class (CORRECT)

This example shows how private-inherited members can still be accessed within the derived class:

```cpp
// This program is fixed
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base
{
    int x;
public:
    void setx(int n) { x = n; }
    void showx() { cout << x << '\n'; }
};

// Inherit base as private
class derived : private base
{
    int y;
public:
    // setx is accessible from within derived
    void setxy(int n, int m) { setx(n); y = m; }
    
    // showx is accessible from within derived
    void showxy() { showx(); cout << y << '\n'; }
};

int main()
{
    derived ob;
    ob.setxy(10, 20);
    ob.showxy();
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation**: Even though `setx()` and `showx()` are private members of `derived` (due to private inheritance), they can still be accessed within the derived class itself. The functions `setxy()` and `showxy()` act as wrapper functions that provide controlled access to the base class functionality.

## EXERCISES

### Exercise 1: Code Analysis

Given this skeleton:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class mybase
{
    int a, b;           // Private members
public:
    int c;              // Public member
    void setab(int i, int j) { a = i; b = j; }
    void getab(int &i, int &j) { i = a; j = b; }
};

class derived1 : public mybase
{
    // ...
};

class derived2 : private mybase
{
    // ...
};

int main()
{
    derived1 o1;
    derived2 o2;
    int i, j;
    // ...
}
```

**Question**: Within main(), which of the following statements are legal?

A. `o1.getab(i, j);`
B. `o2.getab(i, j);`
C. `o1.c = 10;`
D. `o2.c = 10;`

**Answer and Explanation**:

- **A. `o1.getab(i, j);` - LEGAL**
  - `derived1` inherits `mybase` publicly
  - `getab()` is public in `mybase`, so it remains public in `derived1`
  - Can be accessed from `main()`

- **B. `o2.getab(i, j);` - ILLEGAL**
  - `derived2` inherits `mybase` privately
  - `getab()` becomes private in `derived2`
  - Cannot be accessed from `main()`

- **C. `o1.c = 10;` - LEGAL**
  - `derived1` inherits `mybase` publicly
  - `c` is public in `mybase`, so it remains public in `derived1`
  - Can be accessed from `main()`

- **D. `o2.c = 10;` - ILLEGAL**
  - `derived2` inherits `mybase` privately
  - `c` becomes private in `derived2`
  - Cannot be accessed from `main()`

### Exercise 2: Inheritance Rules Summary

**Question**: What happens when a public member is inherited as public? What happens when it is inherited as private?

**Answer**:

**Public Inheritance (`class derived : public base`)**:
- Public members of the base class remain public in the derived class
- These members can be accessed from anywhere in the program
- The derived class maintains the same accessibility as the base class

**Private Inheritance (`class derived : private base`)**:
- Public members of the base class become private members of the derived class
- These members cannot be accessed from outside the derived class
- However, they can still be accessed by member functions within the derived class itself
- The inheritance relationship is hidden from external code

### Exercise 3: Practical Implementation

The exercise suggests trying all examples and experimenting with different access specifiers. Here are some additional experiments you can try:

```cpp
// Experiment 1: Mixed access in derived class
class base
{
public:
    void public_func() { cout << "Public function\n"; }
    void another_public_func() { cout << "Another public function\n"; }
};

class derived : private base
{
public:
    // Make specific base functions public again
    using base::public_func;  // This makes public_func accessible
    // another_public_func remains private
    
    void test_access()
    {
        public_func();         // OK - accessible within derived
        another_public_func(); // OK - accessible within derived
    }
};

// Experiment 2: Multiple inheritance levels
class grandparent
{
public:
    void grandparent_func() { cout << "Grandparent function\n"; }
};

class parent : public grandparent
{
public:
    void parent_func() { cout << "Parent function\n"; }
};

class child : private parent  // Private inheritance
{
public:
    void child_func() { cout << "Child function\n"; }
    void access_ancestors()
    {
        parent_func();      // OK - accessible within child
        grandparent_func(); // OK - accessible within child
    }
};
```

## Summary

Understanding base class access control is crucial for effective C++ inheritance:

1. **Public inheritance** maintains the accessibility of base class members
2. **Private inheritance** hides the base class interface from external code
3. **Private base members** are never accessible to derived classes
4. **Private-inherited members** can still be used within the derived class itself
5. The choice of access specifier affects how the derived class can be used by other parts of the program

This forms the foundation for more advanced inheritance concepts and is essential for proper object-oriented design in C++.
