# C++ Protected Members: Complete Guide

## 7.2 USING PROTECTED MEMBERS

### Introduction

A derived class does not have access to the private members of the base class. This means that if the derived class needs access to some member of the base, that member must be public. However, there are times when you want to keep a member of a base class private but still allow a derived class access to it.

**Solution**: C++ includes the `protected` access specifier to address this need.

### What is Protected Access?

The `protected` access specifier is equivalent to the `private` specifier with **one key exception**:
- **Protected members** of a base class are accessible to members of any class derived from that base
- **Outside** the base or derived classes, protected members are **not accessible**

### Class Declaration Structure

The full general form of a class declaration with all access specifiers:

```cpp
class class_name
{
    // private members (default)
    
protected:  // optional
    // protected members
    
public:
    // public members
};
```

### Protected Member Inheritance Rules

| Base Class Member | Inheritance Type | Becomes in Derived Class |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| `protected` | `public` | `protected` |
| `protected` | `private` | `private` |
| `protected` | `protected` | `protected` |

### Protected Inheritance Rules

When a base class is inherited as `protected`:
- **Public members** of the base class become **protected members** of the derived class
- **Protected members** of the base class become **protected members** of the derived class
- **Private members** of the base class remain **private to the base class**

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Basic Protected Member Access

This program illustrates how public, private, and protected members of a class can be accessed:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class samp
{
    // private by default
    int a;
    
protected:  // still private relative to samp
    int b;
    
public:
    int c;
    
    samp(int n, int m) { a = n; b = m; }
    int geta() { return a; }
    int getb() { return b; }
};

int main()
{
    samp ob(10, 10);
    
    // ob.b = 99;  // ERROR! b is protected and thus private
    ob.c = 30;     // OK, c is public
    
    cout << ob.geta() << ' ';
    cout << ob.getb() << ' ' << ob.c << '\n';
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation**:
- `a` is private - only accessible within `samp` class
- `b` is protected - still private relative to `samp` itself, but would be accessible to derived classes
- `c` is public - accessible from anywhere
- The commented line `ob.b = 99;` is not permissible in `main()` because `b` is protected and thus still private to `samp`
- Protected members are only special when inheritance is involved

### Example 2: Protected Members with Public Inheritance

This program shows what happens when protected members are inherited as public:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base
{
protected:  // private to base
    int a, b;  // but still accessible by derived
    
public:
    void setab(int n, int m) { a = n; b = m; }
};

class derived : public base
{
    int c;
    
public:
    void setc(int n) { c = n; }
    
    // this function has access to a and b from base
    void showbc()
    {
        cout << a << ' ' << b << ' ' << c << '\n';
    }
};

int main()
{
    derived ob;
    
    /*
    a and b are not accessible here because they are
    private to both base and derived.
    */
    
    ob.setab(1, 2);  // OK - setab() is public
    ob.setc(3);      // OK - setc() is public
    ob.showbc();     // OK - showbc() is public
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation**:
- `a` and `b` are protected in `base` and inherited as public by `derived`
- They become protected members of `derived` and are available for use by member functions of `derived`
- Outside of these two classes, `a` and `b` are effectively private and inaccessible
- `showbc()` can access `a` and `b` because it's a member function of the derived class
- In `main()`, we cannot directly access `a` and `b`, but we can use public functions to manipulate them

### Example 3: Protected Inheritance (COMPILATION ERROR)

This example shows what happens when a base class is inherited as protected:

```cpp
// This program will not compile
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base
{
protected:  // private to base
    int a, b;  // but still accessible by derived
    
public:
    void setab(int n, int m) { a = n; b = m; }
};

class derived : protected base  // inherit as protected
{
    int c;
    
public:
    void setc(int n) { c = n; }
    
    // this function has access to a and b from base
    void showabc()
    {
        cout << a << ' ' << b << ' ' << c << '\n';
    }
};

int main()
{
    derived ob;
    
    // ERROR: setab() is now a protected member of derived
    ob.setab(1, 2);  // setab() is not accessible here
    
    ob.setc(3);      // OK - setc() is public in derived
    ob.showabc();    // OK - showabc() is public in derived
    
    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation**:
- Because `base` is inherited as `protected`, its public and protected elements become protected members of `derived`
- `setab()` was public in `base`, but becomes protected in `derived`
- Therefore, `setab()` is not accessible within `main()`
- `a` and `b` are still accessible within `derived` class member functions
- Only `setc()` and `showabc()` remain public in `derived`

## EXERCISES

### Exercise 1: Protected Member Inheritance Analysis

**Question**: What happens when a protected member is inherited as public? What happens when it is inherited as private? What happens when it is inherited as protected?

**Answer**:

#### Protected Member Inherited as Public
```cpp
class base {
protected:
    int x;
};

class derived : public base {
    // x becomes protected in derived
    void func() { x = 10; }  // OK - can access x
};
```
- **Result**: The protected member remains **protected** in the derived class
- **Access**: Accessible to the derived class and its further derived classes
- **External Access**: Not accessible from outside the class hierarchy

#### Protected Member Inherited as Private
```cpp
class base {
protected:
    int x;
};

class derived : private base {
    // x becomes private in derived
    void func() { x = 10; }  // OK - can access x
};

class further_derived : public derived {
    void func() { x = 10; }  // ERROR - x is private in derived
};
```
- **Result**: The protected member becomes **private** in the derived class
- **Access**: Accessible only within the derived class itself
- **Further Inheritance**: Not accessible to classes derived from this derived class

#### Protected Member Inherited as Protected
```cpp
class base {
protected:
    int x;
};

class derived : protected base {
    // x remains protected in derived
    void func() { x = 10; }  // OK - can access x
};

class further_derived : public derived {
    void func() { x = 10; }  // OK - can access x
};
```
- **Result**: The protected member remains **protected** in the derived class
- **Access**: Accessible to the derived class and its further derived classes
- **External Access**: Not accessible from outside the class hierarchy

### Exercise 2: Why Protected Category is Needed

**Question**: Explain why the protected category is needed?

**Answer**:

The `protected` access specifier is needed for several important reasons:

#### 1. **Controlled Access in Inheritance Hierarchies**
```cpp
class Shape {
protected:
    double area;  // Should be accessible to derived classes
                 // but not to external code
public:
    virtual double getArea() = 0;
};

class Rectangle : public Shape {
public:
    double getArea() override {
        return area;  // Can access protected member
    }
    void setDimensions(double w, double h) {
        area = w * h;  // Can modify protected member
    }
};
```

#### 2. **Encapsulation with Inheritance Support**
- **Private**: Too restrictive - derived classes cannot access
- **Public**: Too permissive - external code can access
- **Protected**: Just right - only derived classes can access

#### 3. **Implementation Sharing**
```cpp
class Database {
protected:
    string connection_string;  // Implementation detail
    void connect() { /* ... */ }  // Helper function
    
public:
    virtual void query(string sql) = 0;
};

class MySQLDatabase : public Database {
public:
    void query(string sql) override {
        connect();  // Can use protected helper
        // MySQL-specific implementation
    }
};
```

#### 4. **Framework Design**
Protected members are essential for:
- **Template Method Pattern**: Base class defines algorithm structure, derived classes implement steps
- **Framework Classes**: Provide protected hooks for customization
- **Abstract Base Classes**: Share common implementation details

### Exercise 3: Revisiting Previous Exercise with Protected Members

**Question**: In Exercise 1 from Section 7.1, if the a and b inside myclass were made into protected instead of private (by default) members, would any of your answers to that exercise change? If so, how?

**Original Code from Section 7.1**:
```cpp
class mybase
{
    int a, b;  // Originally private
public:
    int c;
    void setab(int i, int j) { a = i; b = j; }
    void getab(int &i, int &j) { i = a; j = b; }
};
```

**Modified Code with Protected Members**:
```cpp
class mybase
{
protected:  // Changed from private to protected
    int a, b;
public:
    int c;
    void setab(int i, int j) { a = i; b = j; }
    void getab(int &i, int &j) { i = a; j = b; }
};

class derived1 : public mybase
{
    // Now a and b are protected members here
    void someFunction() {
        a = 10;  // NOW LEGAL - can access protected members
        b = 20;  // NOW LEGAL - can access protected members
    }
};

class derived2 : private mybase
{
    // Now a and b are private members here
    void someFunction() {
        a = 10;  // NOW LEGAL - can access (now private) members
        b = 20;  // NOW LEGAL - can access (now private) members
    }
};
```

**Answer**: Yes, the answers would change significantly:

**Original Exercise Results** (with private a, b):
- A. `o1.getab(i, j);` - LEGAL
- B. `o2.getab(i, j);` - ILLEGAL  
- C. `o1.c = 10;` - LEGAL
- D. `o2.c = 10;` - ILLEGAL

**New Results with Protected a, b**:
- A. `o1.getab(i, j);` - **STILL LEGAL** (public function)
- B. `o2.getab(i, j);` - **STILL ILLEGAL** (function becomes private due to private inheritance)
- C. `o1.c = 10;` - **STILL LEGAL** (public member)
- D. `o2.c = 10;` - **STILL ILLEGAL** (member becomes private due to private inheritance)

**Additional Access Now Possible**:
```cpp
class derived1 : public mybase
{
public:
    void directAccess() {
        a = 100;  // NOW LEGAL - protected members accessible
        b = 200;  // NOW LEGAL - protected members accessible
    }
};

class derived2 : private mybase
{
public:
    void directAccess() {
        a = 100;  // NOW LEGAL - protected members accessible within derived class
        b = 200;  // NOW LEGAL - protected members accessible within derived class
    }
};
```

**Key Changes**:
1. **Within derived classes**: `a` and `b` are now directly accessible
2. **External access**: No change - still cannot access `a` and `b` from `main()`
3. **Member functions**: Can now directly manipulate `a` and `b` without using `setab()`

## Summary

Protected members provide a crucial middle ground between private and public access:

1. **Protected members** are accessible to derived classes but not to external code
2. **Protected inheritance** makes public and protected members of the base class protected in the derived class
3. **Use cases** include framework design, template method pattern, and controlled access in inheritance hierarchies
4. **Design principle**: Use protected when you want to share implementation details with derived classes while maintaining encapsulation from external code

Understanding protected access is essential for effective object-oriented design and creating robust inheritance hierarchies in C++.
