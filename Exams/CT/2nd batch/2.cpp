/*
Q2. University Management System (Polymorphism)
ðŸ“Œ Concepts Covered

Abstract Class: A class that cannot be instantiated; may contain abstract methods.

Pure Virtual Function (C++) / Abstract Method (Java): Must be overridden in derived classes.

Run-time Polymorphism: Achieved via method overriding + base class reference pointing to derived objects.

Dynamic Method Dispatch: Java automatically decides which method to call at runtime.

ðŸ“Œ Requirements

Abstract class Person with methods:

showRole()

performDuty()

Derived classes:

Professor â†’ Conducts lectures

Student â†’ Attends classes

AdminStaff â†’ Manages university records

Use base class reference (Person p = new Professor()) for dynamic dispatch.
