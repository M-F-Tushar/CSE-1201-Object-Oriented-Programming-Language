Q5 (a) Purpose of a method parameter. Difference between parameter and argument. [8 marks]

Parameter = variable declared in method signature (e.g., void f(int x) → x is a parameter). Parameters are placeholders in function definition.

Argument = actual value passed when you call the method (e.g., f(5) → 5 is an argument).
Why parameters?

They let you pass data into methods so the same method can work with different inputs (reusability).

Parameters can be pass-by-value for primitives in Java, and for object references Java passes the reference by value (not the object by reference).
