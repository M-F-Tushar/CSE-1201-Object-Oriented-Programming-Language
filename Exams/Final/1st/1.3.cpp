Q1 (c) Given class sample, declare object ob with a = 10 and c = 'X'. [10 marks]

Class:

class sample {
  int a;
  char c;
public:
  sample(int x, char ch) { a = x; c = ch; }
};


Declaration:

sample ob(10, 'X');


Explanation: The constructor sample(int, char) takes two parameters. When you write sample ob(10, 'X'); the constructor runs and sets a=10 and c='X'.
