Q4 (a) What are containers, algorithms, and iterators in STL? [5 marks]

Containers: Data structures that hold objects (e.g., vector, list, map).

Algorithms: Generic functions that operate on ranges defined by iterators (sort, find, accumulate).

Iterators: Objects that point to elements inside containers and allow traversal (like generalized pointers). Algorithms use iterators to be container-agnostic.
