Q5 (a)
Pure Virtual Function:

A pure virtual function is a virtual function that has no body in the base class.

It is declared using = 0.

Example:

class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() = 0;  // pure virtual function
};

How it makes a class Abstract?

A class with at least one pure virtual function becomes an abstract class.

Abstract class cannot be instantiated (objects canâ€™t be created).

It must be inherited by another class that implements the pure virtual function.
